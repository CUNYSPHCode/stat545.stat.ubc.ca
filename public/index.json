Tools and techniques from the course are applied very competently and, perhaps,somewhat creatively. Chosen task was acceptable, but fairly conservative in ambition. Student does not display the expected level of mastery of the tools and techniques in this course. Chosen task was too limited in scope.

This assignment should go smoothly, but if the computer gods do not smile upon you, we should be able to straighten things out in class or office hours.\nAs you work on the assignment, you are welcome to work from the browser (i.e., directly on GitHub), but we encourage you to pilot a more powerful workflow:\n Pull from GitHub (just an empty precaution now, but will matter when you collaborate with others). Make changes locally to local files – RStudio is a great Markdown editor! Click Preview to see how it’s going to look! Save your changes. Commit your changes to your repo. Push the commit to GitHub.  Evaluation The rubrics used for this assignment are:\n Coding style Coding strategy Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work  For more details on rubrics, see the assignments page.\nYou’ll be creating two types of content, as we elaborate on below (the README and the R Markdown). They are equally weighed.\n  Create your hw01 repo This is the first time STAT 545 is using GitHub Classroom! GitHub Classroom will make a repository for you, called hw01-your_github_username, for you to work on your assignment. FYI, it is public. Follow these instructions to get the repo:\nSign in to UBC canvas. Go to the hw01 page. You will find a url leading to a page on GitHub Classroom – go ahead and visit the page and follow the instructions. But note:  You’ll be asked to find/pair your github username. If it’s not on the list, please (1) click “Skip” to skip this step, and (2) fill out the course survey so that you can be added to the roster.   When you obtain your repository, it should contain this very .md file, and a blank README.md file.\n GitHub-Flavoured Markdown: edit README.md Your task here is to edit the README.md file in your repository to contain a sampler of GitHub-flavoured markdown features.\nThe beginning of the README should contain a very brief description as to what the repository is, so that an unknowing visitor landing on the repository can orient themselves. You should also help the visitor navigate your repository (in whatever way you think is most appropriate).\nThe next piece of information that your README should contain is an introduction to yourself. Here’s where you should elaborate and test out various GitHub-flavoured markdown features.\nAt the very least, change README.md to something like “This is the repository of Jane Hacker”, just to prove you have been there. Practice making a link, for example, to the main STAT545 webpage.\nMuch better is to introduce yourself, showcasing a suite of GitHub-flavoured markdown functionality (you might find GitHub’s cheatsheet useful for this).\nHere’s a sample readme file. The Help menu in RStudio will bring up a Markdown Quick Reference at any time.\n R Markdown for Gapminder exploration Make an R Markdown document that explores a dataset, such as gapminder seen in class. You don’t need an extensive exploration in order to get a good grade here; a basic one will do, not unlike the one done in class, which would be considered sufficient (but less so the more verbatim your submission is). Render your R Markdown to the github_document output format. Commit both the .Rmd and .md files and push them to GitHub.\nGive this a decent name, such as hw01_gapminder.Rmd (which will produce a companion file, hw01_gapminder.md).\n Reflection Once you’re done the above, go back to UBC canvas, and find the “Homework 01” page. Here, you should submit a reflection (and, although not required, adding a link to your homework respository would be helpful for the markers).\nPlease don’t skip this reflection! We really care about this.\nSome things you can include:\n A description of how you got the changes into README.md on GitHub.  Did you edit in the browser at github.com? Did you pull, edit locally, save, commit, push to github.com?  How did it all work for the R Markdown document? You’re encouraged to reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc.   Special Submission Cases Are you worried about submitting early, and then wanting to make changes that are included in your submission?\nDon’t be. We’ll always grade your GitHub repository as it was at the last commit prior to the deadline. Therefore, we encourage you to submit early and often, especially regarding your GitHub repository!\nWant to submit early, and continue making contributions to your repository that you don’t want to be graded?\nJust create a release of your homework repo, and include the link to this release in your submission, being sure to indicate that this is a special early release that you want graded.

Instead, it is meant to illustrate the range of what\u0026rsquo;s possible in the world of Markdown. If you feel inspired by any part of this document, click the raw button above this file to see the source code that made it possible.\nFeatures The header above is \u0026ldquo;H2\u0026rdquo; size. The headers below will range from \u0026ldquo;H2\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;H4\u0026rdquo; depending on the number of hashtags in front of them\nBasic Word Processing and Manipulation Bold statements! Want to italicize something? Maybe even bold or strikeout a phrase? How about combining a few of them at a time? For that, Markdown has you covered.\nBullet point basics  How about lists? They work nicely too  Sometimes  we can  even  indent them      What if we want ordered lists?\n They are easy to pull off as well. We can even  have non-ordered lists nested into the numbered ones  Or vice versa. Isn\u0026rsquo;t that great?    Header how-tos The header above is \u0026ldquo;H4\u0026rdquo; size. This readme document\u0026rsquo;s headers\u0026rsquo; sizes range from \u0026ldquo;H2\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;H4\u0026rdquo; depending on the number of hashtags in front of them\nQuoting quotables Starting a line with a simple \u0026gt; turns words into quotes. Take, for example, this perspicacious line from the great Sir Arthur Conan Doyle of Sherlock Holmes fame:\n \u0026ldquo;It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.\u0026rdquo;\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle\n Citing code Code can be cited too! And you can highlight your code too if you specify the source programming language.\nwhatsyour \u0026lt;- function(x) { # Determines whether your function is Conjunction or Junction based on # arbitrary criteria # # Args: # x: A number of some sort. Or not, that works too (We're not picky) # # Returns: # The truth. if(x \u0026gt; 1) { print('Conjunction') } else { print('Junction') } }  Imagining images They say a picture is worth 1000 words - but have you ever considered how many lines of code that might convert to? Regardless of the answer, Markdown makes it easy include pictures of all sorts into your document. Don\u0026rsquo;t believe me? See the source code yourself!\nWe can even include gifs. Fancy that?\nLink logic Let\u0026rsquo;s say that the comic sourced in the previous section had a home page where it could be viewed - we can link to that page using Markdown with relative ease. If you look at the source code, it\u0026rsquo;s really quite simple, so there\u0026rsquo;s not much more to say about this here!\nHTML has you covered for everything else Finding it hard to do that one thing that you want to do with Markdown? Prefer using \u0026lt;a href = \u0026quot;destination\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Word\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; instead of Markdown\u0026rsquo;s [Word](destination) syntax? Well, as you can see at this link, it is possible to use inline HTML for markup that is not covered otherwise by Markdown. That said, Markdown syntax can tackle most of the crucial functions required for this readme file and most others like it.\nSome common uses for incorporating HTML inline with Markdown include:\n Using an image as a link Including non-bordered tables to create makeshift columns Facilitating perfectionism  Further Reading and Resources Still confused?

In particular, to begin to establish a workflow for data frames or “tibbles”. You will use dplyr and ggplot2 to do some description and visualization.\nDue by 23:59 Tuesday 2018-09-25, but I highly recommend you aim to submit before class. This assignment should go smoothly, but if the computer gods do not smile upon you, we should be able to straighten things out in class or office hours.\nYour homework should serve as your own personal cheatsheet in the future for things to do with a new dataset. Give yourself the cheatsheet you deserve!\nEvaluation All rubrics listed on the assignments page are relevant for this assignment.\nHere’s an “overall” view of the scores:\n0: Didn’t attempt.\n1: There are some mistakes or omissions, such as the number of rows or variables in the data frame. Or maybe no confirmation of its class or that of the variables inside. There are no plots or there’s just one type of plot (and its probably a scatterplot). There’s no use of filter() or select(). It’s hard to figure out which file I’m supposed to be looking at. Maybe the student forgot to commit and push the figures to GitHub.\n2: Hits all the elements. No obvious mistakes. Pleasant to read. No heroic detective work required. Solid.\n3: Some “above and beyond”, creativity, etc. You learned something new from reviewing their work and you’re eager to incorporate it into your work now. Use of dplyr goes beyond filter() and select(). The ggplot2 figures are quite diverse. The repo is very organized and it’s a breeze to find the file for this homework specifically.\n  Bring rectangular data in Work with the gapminder data we explored in class. If you really want to, you can explore a different dataset. Self-assess the suitability of your dataset by reading this issue, and if you still aren’t sure if it’s suitable, send Vincenzo an email.\nThe Gapminder data is distributed as an R package from CRAN.\nInstall it if you have not done so already and remember to load it.\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;gapminder\u0026quot;) library(gapminder) Install and load dplyr. Probably via the tidyverse meta-package.\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;) library(tidyverse)  Smell test the data Explore the gapminder object:\n Is it a data.frame, a matrix, a vector, a list? What is its class? How many variables/columns? How many rows/observations? Can you get these facts about “extent” or “size” in more than one way? Can you imagine different functions being useful in different contexts? What data type is each variable?  Be sure to justify your answers by calling the appropriate R functions.\n Explore individual variables Pick at least one categorical variable and at least one quantitative variable to explore.\n What are possible values (or range, whichever is appropriate) of each variable? What values are typical? What’s the spread? What’s the distribution? Etc., tailored to the variable at hand. Feel free to use summary stats, tables, figures. We’re NOT expecting high production value (yet).   Explore various plot types Make a few plots, probably of the same variable you chose to characterize numerically. You can use the plot types we went over in class (cm006) to get an idea of what you’d like to make. Try to explore more than one plot type. Just as an example of what I mean:\n A scatterplot of two quantitative variables. A plot of one quantitative variable. Maybe a histogram or densityplot or frequency polygon. A plot of one quantitative variable and one categorical. Maybe boxplots for several continents or countries.  You don’t have to use all the data in every plot! It’s fine to filter down to one country or small handful of countries.\n Use filter(), select() and %\u0026gt;% Use filter() to create data subsets that you want to plot.\nPractice piping together filter() and select(). Possibly even piping into ggplot().\n But I want to do more! For people who want to take things further.\nEvaluate this code and describe the result. Presumably the analyst’s intent was to get the data for Rwanda and Afghanistan. Did they succeed? Why or why not? If not, what is the correct way to do this?\nfilter(gapminder, country == c(\u0026quot;Rwanda\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Afghanistan\u0026quot;)) Read What I do when I get a new data set as told through tweets from SimplyStatistics to get some ideas!\nPresent numerical tables in a more attractive form, such as using knitr::kable().\nUse more of the dplyr functions for operating on a single table.\nAdapt exercises from the chapters in the “Explore” section of R for Data Science to the Gapminder dataset.\n Reflection Once you’re done the above, go back to UBC canvas, and find the “Homework 02” page. Here, you should submit a reflection (and, although not required, adding a link to your homework respository would be helpful for the markers).\nPlease don’t skip this reflection! We really care about this.\nReflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc. What things were hard, even though you saw them in class? What was easy(-ish) even though we haven’t done it in class?\n Special Submission Cases Are you worried about submitting early, and then wanting to make changes that are included in your submission?\nDon’t be. We’ll always grade your GitHub repository as it was at the last commit prior to the deadline.

Give yourself the cheatsheet you deserve!\nEvaluation All rubrics listed on the assignments page are relevant for this assignment.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an \u0026ldquo;overall\u0026rdquo; view of the scores:\n0: Didn\u0026rsquo;t attempt.\n1: There are some mistakes or omissions, such as the number of rows or variables in the data frame. Or maybe no confirmation of its class or that of the variables inside. There are no plots or there\u0026rsquo;s just one type of plot (and its probably a scatterplot). There\u0026rsquo;s no use of filter() or select(). It\u0026rsquo;s hard to figure out which file I\u0026rsquo;m supposed to be looking at. Maybe the student forgot to commit and push the figures to GitHub.\n2: Hits all the elements. No obvious mistakes. Pleasant to read. No heroic detective work required. Solid.\n3: Some \u0026ldquo;above and beyond\u0026rdquo;, creativity, etc. You learned something new from reviewing their work and you\u0026rsquo;re eager to incorporate it into your work now. Use of dplyr goes beyond filter() and select(). The ggplot2 figures are quite diverse. The repo is very organized and it\u0026rsquo;s a breeze to find the file for this homework specifically.\nBring rectangular data in Work with the gapminder data we explored in class. If you really want to, you can explore a different dataset. Self-assess the suitability of your dataset by reading this issue, and if you still aren\u0026rsquo;t sure if it\u0026rsquo;s suitable, send Vincenzo an email.\nThe Gapminder data is distributed as an R package from CRAN.\nInstall it if you have not done so already and remember to load it.\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;gapminder\u0026quot;) library(gapminder)  Install and load dplyr. Probably via the tidyverse meta-package.\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;) library(tidyverse)  Smell test the data Explore the gapminder object:\n Is it a data.frame, a matrix, a vector, a list? What is its class? How many variables/columns? How many rows/observations? Can you get these facts about \u0026ldquo;extent\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;size\u0026rdquo; in more than one way? Can you imagine different functions being useful in different contexts? What data type is each variable?  Be sure to justify your answers by calling the appropriate R functions.\nExplore individual variables Pick at least one categorical variable and at least one quantitative variable to explore.\n What are possible values (or range, whichever is appropriate) of each variable? What values are typical? What\u0026rsquo;s the spread? What\u0026rsquo;s the distribution? Etc., tailored to the variable at hand. Feel free to use summary stats, tables, figures. We\u0026rsquo;re NOT expecting high production value (yet).  Explore various plot types Make a few plots, probably of the same variable you chose to characterize numerically. You can use the plot types we went over in class (cm006) to get an idea of what you\u0026rsquo;d like to make. Try to explore more than one plot type. Just as an example of what I mean:\n A scatterplot of two quantitative variables. A plot of one quantitative variable. Maybe a histogram or densityplot or frequency polygon. A plot of one quantitative variable and one categorical. Maybe boxplots for several continents or countries.  You don\u0026rsquo;t have to use all the data in every plot! It\u0026rsquo;s fine to filter down to one country or small handful of countries.\nUse filter(), select() and %\u0026gt;% Use filter() to create data subsets that you want to plot.\nPractice piping together filter() and select(). Possibly even piping into ggplot().\nBut I want to do more! For people who want to take things further.\nEvaluate this code and describe the result. Presumably the analyst\u0026rsquo;s intent was to get the data for Rwanda and Afghanistan. Did they succeed? Why or why not? If not, what is the correct way to do this?\nfilter(gapminder, country == c(\u0026quot;Rwanda\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Afghanistan\u0026quot;))  Read What I do when I get a new data set as told through tweets from SimplyStatistics to get some ideas!\nPresent numerical tables in a more attractive form, such as using knitr::kable().\nUse more of the dplyr functions for operating on a single table.\nAdapt exercises from the chapters in the \u0026ldquo;Explore\u0026rdquo; section of R for Data Science to the Gapminder dataset.\nReflection Once you\u0026rsquo;re done the above, go back to UBC canvas, and find the \u0026ldquo;Homework 02\u0026rdquo; page. Here, you should submit a reflection (and, although not required, adding a link to your homework respository would be helpful for the markers).\nPlease don\u0026rsquo;t skip this reflection! We really care about this.\nReflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc. What things were hard, even though you saw them in class? What was easy(-ish) even though we haven\u0026rsquo;t done it in class?\nSpecial Submission Cases Are you worried about submitting early, and then wanting to make changes that are included in your submission?\nDon\u0026rsquo;t be. We\u0026rsquo;ll always grade your GitHub repository as it was at the last commit prior to the deadline. Therefore, we encourage you to submit early and often, especially regarding your GitHub repository!\nWant to submit early, and continue making contributions to your repository that you don\u0026rsquo;t want to be graded?\nJust create a release of your homework repo, and include the link to this release in your submission, being sure to indicate that this is a special early release that you want graded.

Many of your tables will be awkwardly shaped in the report. That’s OK. Table beauty is not a big deal. Simply printing to “screen” is fine. You could also try the knitr::kable() function. Assuming my_df is a data.frame, here’s an R chunk that should print it as a decent-looking table:  ```{r results = 'asis'} knitr::kable(my_df) ```  For all things, graphical and tabular, if you’re dissatisfied with a result, discuss the problem, what you’ve tried and move on. Your figure does not have to depict every single number from the data aggregation result. Use your judgement. It just needs to complement the table, add context, and allow for some sanity checking both ways.   Task menu Here are some sample tasks for you to populate your cheat sheet with. If you want to do something comparable but different, i.e. swap one quantitative variable for another, be my guest! If you are feeling inspired and curious, then we’re doing this right. Go for it.\n Get the maximum and minimum of GDP per capita for all continents.\n Look at the spread of GDP per capita within the continents.\n Compute a trimmed mean of life expectancy for different years. Or a weighted mean, weighting by population. Just try something other than the plain vanilla mean.\n How is life expectancy changing over time on different continents?\n Report the absolute and/or relative abundance of countries with low life expectancy over time by continent: Compute some measure of worldwide life expectancy – you decide – a mean or median or some other quantile or perhaps your current age. Then determine how many countries on each continent have a life expectancy less than this benchmark, for each year.\n Find countries with interesting stories. Open-ended and, therefore, hard. Promising but unsuccessful attempts are encouraged. This will generate interesting questions to follow up on in class.\n  Or, make up your own!

You know how to use the tidyverse to:\n Filter rows and select variables in a principled or name-based manner Modify variables and create new variables Group rows of a data frame and do summarizing or mutating computations within group Reshape a data frame Get new information into a data frame via a joining  The goal of this homework is to solidify your data wrangling skills by working some realistic problems in the grey area between data aggregation and data reshaping.\nIf you internalize that there are multiple solutions to most problems, you will spend less time banging your head against the wall in data analysis. If something’s really hard, sneak up on it from a different angle.\nEvaluation All rubrics listed on the assignments page are relevant for this assignment.\n  The Assignment This is a “choose your own adventure”-style assignment, where you are expected to do the following two things:\nPick one of the data reshaping prompts and do it. Pick one of the join prompts and do it.  It is fine to work with a new dataset and/or create variations on these problem themes.\nData Reshaping Prompts (and relationship to aggregation) Problem: You have data in one “shape” but you wish it were in another. Usually this is because the alternative shape is superior for presenting a table, making a figure, or doing aggregation and statistical analysis.\nSolution: Reshape your data. For simple reshaping, gather() and spread() from tidyr will suffice. Do the thing that is possible / easier now that your data has a new shape.\nPrompts:\nActivity #1\n Make your own cheatsheet similar to Tyler Rinker’s minimal guide to tidyr.  Activity #2\n Make a tibble with one row per year and columns for life expectancy for two or more countries.  Use knitr::kable() to make this table look pretty in your rendered homework. Take advantage of this new data shape to scatterplot life expectancy for one country against that of another.   Activity #3\n Compute some measure of life expectancy (mean? median? min? max?) for all possible combinations of continent and year. Reshape that to have one row per year and one variable for each continent. Or the other way around: one row per continent and one variable per year.  Use knitr::kable() to make these tables look pretty in your rendered homework. Is there a plot that is easier to make with the data in this shape versis the usual form? If so (or you think so), try it! Reflect.   Activity #4\n In Window functions, we formed a tibble with 24 rows: 2 per year, giving the country with both the lowest and highest life expectancy (in Asia). Take that table (or a similar one for all continents) and reshape it so you have one row per year or per year * continent combination.  Activity #5\n Previous TA Andrew MacDonald has a nice data manipulation sampler. Make up a similar set of exercises for yourself, in the abstract or (even better) using Gapminder or other data, and solve them.   Join Prompts (join, merge, look up) Problem: You have two data sources and you need info from both in one new data object.\nSolution: Perform a join, which borrows terminology from the database world, specifically SQL.\nPrompts:\nActivity #1\n Create a second data frame, complementary to Gapminder. Join this with (part of) Gapminder using a dplyr join function and make some observations about the process and result. Explore the different types of joins. Examples of a second data frame you could build:  One row per country, a country variable and one or more variables with extra info, such as language spoken, NATO membership, national animal, or capitol city. One row per continent, a continent variable and one or more variables with extra info, such as northern versus southern hemisphere.   Activity #2\n Create your own cheatsheet patterned after Jenny’s but focused on something you care about more than comics! Inspirational examples:  Pets I have owned + breed + friendly vs. unfriendly + ??. Join to a table of pet breed, including variables for furry vs not furry, mammal true or false, etc. Movies and studios…. Athletes and teams….   You will likely need to iterate between your data prep and your joining to make your explorations comprehensive and interesting. For example, you will want a specific amount (or lack) of overlap between the two data.frames, in order to demonstrate all the different joins. You will want both the data frames to be as small as possible, while still retaining the expository value.\nActivity #3\n This is really an optional add-on to either of the previous activities. Explore the base R function merge(), which also does joins. Compare and contrast with dplyr joins. Explore the base R function match(), which is related to joins and merges, but is really more of a “table lookup”. Compare and contrast with a true join/merge.   Finishing up, and Reflection Once you’re done the above, go back to UBC canvas, and find the “Homework 04” page.\nYou’re encouraged to reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc. As usual, put this reflection on your canvas submission.

It is fine to work with a new dataset and/or create variations on these problem themes.\nData Reshaping Prompts (and relationship to aggregation) Problem: You have data in one \u0026ldquo;shape\u0026rdquo; but you wish it were in another. Usually this is because the alternative shape is superior for presenting a table, making a figure, or doing aggregation and statistical analysis.\nSolution: Reshape your data. For simple reshaping, gather() and spread() from tidyr will suffice. Do the thing that is possible / easier now that your data has a new shape.\nPrompts:\nActivity #1\n Make your own cheatsheet similar to Tyler Rinker\u0026rsquo;s minimal guide to tidyr.  Activity #2\n Make a tibble with one row per year and columns for life expectancy for two or more countries.  Use knitr::kable() to make this table look pretty in your rendered homework. Take advantage of this new data shape to scatterplot life expectancy for one country against that of another.   Activity #3\n Compute some measure of life expectancy (mean? median? min? max?) for all possible combinations of continent and year. Reshape that to have one row per year and one variable for each continent. Or the other way around: one row per continent and one variable per year.  Use knitr::kable() to make these tables look pretty in your rendered homework. Is there a plot that is easier to make with the data in this shape versis the usual form? If so (or you think so), try it! Reflect.   Activity #4\n In Window functions, we formed a tibble with 24 rows: 2 per year, giving the country with both the lowest and highest life expectancy (in Asia). Take that table (or a similar one for all continents) and reshape it so you have one row per year or per year * continent combination.  Activity #5\n Previous TA Andrew MacDonald has a nice data manipulation sampler. Make up a similar set of exercises for yourself, in the abstract or (even better) using Gapminder or other data, and solve them.  Join Prompts (join, merge, look up) Problem: You have two data sources and you need info from both in one new data object.\nSolution: Perform a join, which borrows terminology from the database world, specifically SQL.\nPrompts:\nActivity #1\n Create a second data frame, complementary to Gapminder. Join this with (part of) Gapminder using a dplyr join function and make some observations about the process and result. Explore the different types of joins. Examples of a second data frame you could build:  One row per country, a country variable and one or more variables with extra info, such as language spoken, NATO membership, national animal, or capitol city. One row per continent, a continent variable and one or more variables with extra info, such as northern versus southern hemisphere.   Activity #2\n Create your own cheatsheet patterned after Jenny\u0026rsquo;s but focused on something you care about more than comics! Inspirational examples:  Pets I have owned + breed + friendly vs. unfriendly + ??. Join to a table of pet breed, including variables for furry vs not furry, mammal true or false, etc. Movies and studios\u0026hellip;. Athletes and teams\u0026hellip;.   You will likely need to iterate between your data prep and your joining to make your explorations comprehensive and interesting. For example, you will want a specific amount (or lack) of overlap between the two data.frames, in order to demonstrate all the different joins. You will want both the data frames to be as small as possible, while still retaining the expository value.\nActivity #3\n This is really an optional add-on to either of the previous activities. Explore the base R function merge(), which also does joins. Compare and contrast with dplyr joins. Explore the base R function match(), which is related to joins and merges, but is really more of a \u0026ldquo;table lookup\u0026rdquo;. Compare and contrast with a true join/merge.  Finishing up, and Reflection Once you\u0026rsquo;re done the above, go back to UBC canvas, and find the \u0026ldquo;Homework 04\u0026rdquo; page.\nYou\u0026rsquo;re encouraged to reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc. As usual, put this reflection on your canvas submission.

Write some data to file and load it back into R. Improve a figure (or make one from scratch), using new knowledge, e.g., control the color scheme, use factor levels, smoother mechanics. Make a plotly visual. Implement visualization design principles.  Remember the sampler concept. Your homework should serve as your own personal cheatsheet in the future for canonical tasks. Make things nice – your future self will thank you!\nEvaluation All rubrics listed on the assignments page are relevant for this assignment.\nFor this assignment, you can think of the scores loosely this way:\n0: Did not attempt.\n1: One or more elements are missing or sketchy. Missed opportunities to complement code and numbers with a figure and interpretation. Technical problem that is relatively easy to fix. It’s hard to find the report in this crazy repo.\n2: Hits all the elements. No obvious mistakes. Pleasant to read. No heroic detective work required. Well done!\n3: Exceeded the requirements in number of dimensions. Developed novel tasks that were indeed interesting and “worked”. Impressive use of R – maybe involving functions, packages or workflows that weren’t given in class materials. Impeccable organization of repo and report. You learned something new from reviewing their work and you’re eager to incorporate it into your work.\n Data You can work with the gapminder data, or adapt the tasks to suit some other data set, such as Joey’s singer dataset.\n  The Assignment Part 1: Factor management With the data set of your choice, after ensuring the variable(s) you’re exploring are indeed factors, you are expected to:\nDrop factor / levels; Reorder levels based on knowledge from data.  We’ve elaborated on these steps for the gapminder and singer data sets below.\nBe sure to also characterize the (derived) data before and after your factor re-leveling:\n Explore the effects of arrange(). Does merely arranging the data have any effect on, say, a figure? Explore the effects of reordering a factor and factor reordering coupled with arrange(). Especially, what effect does this have on a figure?  These explorations should involve the data, the factor levels, and some figures.\nElaboration for the gapminder data set Drop Oceania. Filter the Gapminder data to remove observations associated with the continent of Oceania. Additionally, remove unused factor levels. Provide concrete information on the data before and after removing these rows and Oceania; address the number of rows and the levels of the affected factors.\nReorder the levels of country or continent. Use the forcats package to change the order of the factor levels, based on a principled summary of one of the quantitative variables. Consider experimenting with a summary statistic beyond the most basic choice of the median.\n Elaboration for the Singer data set If necessary, transform some of the variables in the singer_locations dataframe into factors: pay attention at what levels you introduce and their order. Try and consider the difference between the base R as.factor and the forcats-provided functions.\nDrop 0. Filter the singer_locations data to remove observations associated with the uncorrectly inputed year 0. Additionally, remove unused factor levels. Provide concrete information on the data before and after removing these rows and levels; address the number of rows and the levels of the affected factors.\nReorder the levels of year, artist_name or title. Use the forcats package to change the order of the factor levels, based on a principled summary of one of the quantitative variables. Consider experimenting with a summary statistic beyond the most basic choice of the median.\n  Part 2: File I/O Experiment with one or more of write_csv()/read_csv() (and/or TSV friends), saveRDS()/readRDS(), dput()/dget(). Create something new, probably by filtering or grouped-summarization of Singer or Gapminder. I highly recommend you fiddle with the factor levels, i.e. make them non-alphabetical (see previous section). Explore whether this survives the round trip of writing to file then reading back in.\n Part 3: Visualization design Remake at least one figure or create a new one, in light of something you learned in the recent class meetings about visualization design and color. Maybe juxtapose your first attempt and what you obtained after some time spent working on it. Reflect on the differences. If using Gapminder, you can use the country or continent color scheme that ships with Gapminder. Consult the dimensions listed in All the Graph Things.\nThen, make a new graph by converting this visual (or another, if you’d like) to a plotly graph. What are some things that plotly makes possible, that are not possible with a regular ggplot2 graph?\n Part 4: Writing figures to file Use ggsave() to explicitly save a plot to file. Then use ![Alt text](/path/to/img.png) to load and embed it in your report. You can play around with various options, such as:\n Arguments of ggsave(), such as width, height, resolution or text scaling. Various graphics devices, e.g. a vector vs. raster format. Explicit provision of the plot object p via ggsave(..., plot = p). Show a situation in which this actually matters.   But I want to do more! If you’re particularly keen on levelling up the challenge of this assignment, try these things (this is all optional):\nMake a deeper exploration of the forcats packages, i.e. try more of the factor level reordering functions.\nRevalue a factor, e.g.:\n Gapminder version: Pick a handful of countries, each of which you can associate with a stereotypical food (or any other non-controversial thing … sport? hobby? type of music, art or dance? animal? landscape feature?). Create an excerpt of the Gapminder data, filtered to just these countries. Create a new factor – you pick the name! – by mapping the existing country factor levels to the new levels.  Examples: Italy –\u0026gt; wine, Germany –\u0026gt; beer, Japan –\u0026gt; sake. (Austria, Germany) –\u0026gt; German, (Mexico, Spain) –\u0026gt; Spanish, (Portugal, Brazil) –\u0026gt; Portuguese. Let your creativity flourish.  Singer version: Pick a handful of locations (they are named city, try using distinct()) that you can pinpoint to a geographical place (city, region, country, continent,…). Create an excerpt of the Singer data, filtered to just those rows. Create a (couple of) new factor(s) – you pick the name(s)! – by mapping the existing city factor levels to the new (city, region, country…) levels.  Examples: “London, England” –\u0026gt; “London”, “England”, “UK”, “Europe”;\n “Los Angeles, CA” –\u0026gt; “Los Angeles”, “California”, “USA”, “Americas”; … “310, Louisiana” –\u0026gt; “New Orleans”, “Louisiana”, “USA”, “Americas”.   You could even try to make this process of geolocalization more streamlined: you may want to try and use the separate function from tidyr.\n Finishing up, and Reflection Once you’re done the above, go back to UBC canvas, and find the “Homework 05” page.\nYou’re encouraged to reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc. As usual, put this reflection on your canvas submission.

Character data Read and work the exercises in the Strings chapter or R for Data Science.\n2. Writing functions Pick one:\n Write one (or more) functions that do something useful to pieces of the Gapminder or Singer data. It is logical to think about computing on the mini-data frames corresponding to the data for each specific country, location, year, band, album, \u0026hellip; This would pair well with the prompt below about working with a nested data frame, as you could apply your function there.  Make it something you can\u0026rsquo;t easily do with built-in functions. Make it something that\u0026rsquo;s not trivial to do with the simple dplyr verbs. The linear regression function presented here is a good starting point. You could generalize that to do quadratic regression (include a squared term) or use robust regression, using MASS::rlm() or robustbase::lmrob().  If you plan to complete the homework where we build an R package, write a couple of experimental functions exploring some functionality that is useful to you in real life and that might form the basis of your personal package.  3. Work with the candy data In 2015, we explored a dataset based on a Halloween candy survey (but it included many other odd and interesting questions). Work on something from this homework from 2015. It is good practice on basic data ingest, exploration, character data cleanup, and wrangling.\n4. Work with the singer data The singer_location dataframe in the singer package contains geographical information stored in two different formats: 1. as a (dirty!) variable named city; 2. as a latitude / longitude pair (stored in latitude, longitude respectively). The function revgeocode from the ggmap library allows you to retrieve some information for a pair (vector) of longitude, latitude (warning: notice the order in which you need to pass lat and long). Read its manual page.\n Use purrr to map latitude and longitude into human readable information on the band\u0026rsquo;s origin places. Notice that revgeocode(... , output = \u0026quot;more\u0026quot;) outputs a dataframe, while revgeocode(... , output = \u0026quot;address\u0026quot;) returns a string: you have the option of dealing with nested dataframes.\nYou will need to pay attention to two things:\n Not all of the track have a latitude and longitude: what can we do with the missing information? (filtering, \u0026hellip;) Not all of the time we make a research through revgeocode() we get a result. What can we do to avoid those errors to bite us? (look at possibly() in purrr\u0026hellip;)  Try to check wether the place in city corresponds to the information you retrieved.\n If you still have time, you can go visual: give a look to the library leaflet and plot some information about the bands. A snippet of code is provided below.\nsinger_locations %\u0026gt;% leaflet() %\u0026gt;% addTiles() %\u0026gt;% addCircles(popup = ~artist_name)   5. Work with a list Work through and write up a lesson from the purrr tutorial:\n Trump Android Tweets Simplifying data from a list of GitHub users  6. Work with a nested data frame Create a nested data frame and map a function over the list column holding the nested data. Use list extraction or other functions to pull interesting information out of these results and work your way back to a simple data frame you can visualize and explore.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a fully developed prompt for Gapminder:\n See the split-apply-combine lesson from Jenny Bryan Nest the data by country (and continent). Fit a model of life expectancy against year. Possibly quadratic, possibly robust (see above prompt re: function writing). Use functions for working with fitted models or the broom package to get information out of your linear models. Use the usual dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2 workflows to explore, e.g., the estimated cofficients.  Inspiration for the modelling and downstream inspiration\n Find countries with interesting stories. - Sudden, substantial departures from the temporal trend is interesting. How could you operationalize this notion of \u0026ldquo;interesting\u0026rdquo;? Use the residuals to detect countries where your model is a terrible fit. Examples: Are there are 1 or more freakishly large residuals, in an absolute sense or relative to some estimate of background variability? Are there strong patterns in the sign of the residuals? E.g., all pos, then all neg, then pos again. Fit a regression using ordinary least squares and a robust technique. Determine the difference in estimated parameters under the two approaches.

For example, are there classes of individuals with similar candy preference profiles?\nSections of the Assignment Examining the raw data and choosing a task Familiarize yourself with the raw data if you haven’t already. Based on the information available, formulate a task you want to complete and explain what it is. Make it fairly specific, like the tasks above.\nWrangling Based on the task you chose, get the data in a workable format. This will likely involve all kinds of fun dropping columns, using regex to clean text and headers, some tidyr for gathering, etc. Divide each step by a unique heading in your document. By the end, you will likely want things in tidy data format so you can easily use dplyr/ggplot for your analysis/exploration.\nExploring/Analyzing Now that your data us ready to analyze, complete the task you set out to complete!

Basically you want to get the fiddliest moving parts working early and then keep it that way. In this case, I assume that means obtaining the foofactors package I have left for you to extend and making sure you can develop your own copy and push it back up to GitHub.\nOption #1: Obtain foofactorsas a ZIP archive\n In browser, create new repo on GitHub named foofactors. Public. NO THANKS re: README, .gitignore, license. Copy the https URL to clipboard. RStudio File \u0026gt; New Project \u0026hellip; \u0026gt; Version Control \u0026gt; Git. Paste the URL \u0026hellip; Create Project. Stage and commit .gitignore and foofactors.Rproj. Push. Refresh view of foofactors repo on GitHub. Do .gitignore and foofactors.Rproj appear? YES, basic local \u0026lt;\u0026ndash;\u0026gt; remote repo stuff set up. Yay. Visit my version of foofactors on GitHub and get it.  https://github.com/jennybc/foofactors Click on \u0026ldquo;Download ZIP\u0026rdquo; button. For me, this gets automatically un-gzipped and un-tarred when the download completes. YMMV. foofactors-master directory now exists in ~/Downloads.  Copy everything from foofactors-master (our stuff) into local foofactors (your stuff). In RStudio, use the Git diff view to make sure things look reasonable. .gitignore and foofactors.Rproj are modified. Lots of other files are brand new. Stage it all and commit. Push. Restart RStudio in your foofactors Project, so RStudio provides package building help, i.e. the Build tab with access to package-y stuff. Test, document, and check the package. Everything OK? Read the errors and deal with them. Check again. OK? Yay. Stage any changes that were necessary, commit, push. Build \u0026amp; Reload. Use fbind() in the Console. Yes, it works.  Option #2: Fork foofactors and get your copy the Git way\n Visit my foofactors in the browser:  https://github.com/jennybc/foofactors  Click \u0026ldquo;Fork\u0026rdquo;. You should arrive in a new repo under your own account that is clearly indicated to be a fork of jennybc/foofactors. Copy the https URL of your fork to clipboard. RStudio File \u0026gt; New Project \u0026hellip; \u0026gt; Version Control \u0026gt; Git. Paste the URL \u0026hellip; Create Project. Test, document, and check the package. Everything OK? Read the errors and deal with them. Check again. OK? Yay. Stage any changes that were necessary, commit, push. Build \u0026amp; Reload. Use fbind() in the Console. Yes, it works.  Now you are ready to start modifying the package. Keep checking, committing, and pushing often.\nInstall your peer\u0026rsquo;s package If you barrel ahead and install your peer\u0026rsquo;s foofactors package for review, it will likely overwrite the installation of your own foofactors package. Note: only your installed package is at risk. The source of your foofactors package lives on safely on your computer and on GitHub. And you could re-install from either source.\nIf you want to be more careful, here are two approaches to take more control of the situation.\nOption A. Install peer\u0026rsquo;s work to different library In this option we install the peer\u0026rsquo;s version of foofactors to a non-default library, leaving the installation of your own version intact.\nFirst, restart your R session. Specifically, we don\u0026rsquo;t want your foofactors package to be loaded before we start this. To confirm this is true, enter search() and make sure you don\u0026rsquo;t see foofactors listed in the result.\nStep 1. Create a temporary library This is nothing more than creating a new directory on your computer. It\u0026rsquo;s where you\u0026rsquo;ll install and load your peer\u0026rsquo;s package from. Then we\u0026rsquo;ll delete it. I\u0026rsquo;m putting in my all purpose temp directory, but you can pick another location.\n tmp_lib \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;~/tmp/tmp_lib\u0026quot; dir.create(tmp_lib)  Navigate to this directory in some file browser or shell and confirm the directory exists.\nStep 2. Install foofactors from your peer Install your peer\u0026rsquo;s foofactors package from GitHub into your temporary library. Below, devtools::with_lib() prepends your usual list of libraries with tmp_lib. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about the deprecation warning on with_lib(). I\u0026rsquo;m also opting to build your peer\u0026rsquo;s vignettes, which may cause some suggested packages to be installed. Load your peer\u0026rsquo;s package from tmp_lib and confirm you\u0026rsquo;re using the right version via maintainer().\n library(devtools) with_lib(tmp_lib, install_github(\u0026quot;rebjoh/foofactors\u0026quot;, build_vignettes = TRUE)) library(foofactors, lib.loc = tmp_lib) maintainer(\u0026quot;foofactors\u0026quot;)  Use the peer\u0026rsquo;s package and submit your review.\nStep 3. Remove peer\u0026rsquo;s work after peer-review Delete your temporary library any way you want. Restart your R session to clean out your loaded packages and rest assured that plain ol\u0026rsquo; library(foofactors) will now load your version. Use maintainer() to check if you are worried. Here\u0026rsquo;s an R command to get rid of the temporary library.\n unlink(tmp_lib, recursive = TRUE)  Option B. Overwrite and re-install In this option you temporarily overwrite your installed version of foofactors with the version of your peer. This means that during the peer review you will not be able to load and run your version of foofactors.\nStep 1. Backup Let\u0026rsquo;s make extra sure your foofactors source package is safely stored locally and on GitHub.\n Is your package in working order, with everything saved and committed and pushed to GitHub? Do it now! Launch RStudio in the Project corresponding to your foofactors package. De-install foofactors and confirm it\u0026rsquo;s truly gone from your library:\nremove.packages(\u0026quot;foofactors\u0026quot;) ## Restart R session library(\u0026quot;foofactors\u0026quot;) ## Error in library(\u0026quot;foofactors\u0026quot;) : there is no package called ‘foofactors’  Re-install foofactors and confirm it\u0026rsquo;s back in your library. Use RStudio\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Build \u0026amp; Reload\u0026rdquo; then call fbind(), get help ?fbind, browse the vignette, etc.\n De-install foofactors again (see above).\n Re-install foofactors from GitHub this time.\nlibrary(devtools) install_github(\u0026quot;YOURGITHUBUSERNAME/foofactors\u0026quot;, build_vignettes = TRUE) library(\u0026quot;foofactors\u0026quot;)  Revisit spot checks from above that foofactors is back and in working order.\n  If everything works as expected, you can feel good that your package source is safely stored locally and on GitHub.\nStep 2. Install foofactors from your peer Now that you know that you can re-install your version of foofactors, it\u0026rsquo;s time to let your peer\u0026rsquo;s version of foofactors take over.\n Install your peer\u0026rsquo;s foofactors, load it, check maintainer:\nlibrary(devtools) install_github(\u0026quot;YOURPEER/foofactors\u0026quot;, build_vignettes = TRUE) library(foofactors) maintainer(\u0026quot;foofactors\u0026quot;) ## USE IT  Review peer\u0026rsquo;s version of foofactors.\n  Step 3. Re-install your version Once you are done with the peer review, restore your own version of foofactors.\n To install from your local source, launch RStudio in your foofactors Project and do \u0026ldquo;Build and Reload\u0026rdquo;. Or install from GitHub\ndevtools::install_github(\u0026quot;YOURGITHUBUSERNAME/foofactors\u0026quot;)  Either way, verify your version is now installed:\nmaintainer(\u0026quot;foofactors\u0026quot;)   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"0ffc7d7de9b2ca8d7fcefa2c2f95d893","permalink":"/evaluation/hw07/hw07-help/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/evaluation/hw07/hw07-help/","section":"evaluation","summary":"Help on the package homework (hw07) Here is how to\n Get started on the package homework Install your peer\u0026rsquo;s package for review  If you don\u0026rsquo;t need help with either of these, then carry on.\nGet to the starting line Here\u0026rsquo;s how I would start the homework on making an R package.

Give function arguments sensible defaults, where relevant. Document all exported functions. Include at least three unit tests for your new function that test common use cases that you anticipate of the function. Your package should pass check() without errors (warnings and notes are OK). Update the README and vignette to show usage of all the functions in the package. Modify the instructions telling someone how to install your package.  Ideas for more foofactor functions to write:\n detect factors that should be character because # unique values = length write a version of reorder() that uses desc() a la (d)plyr write a version of factor() that sets levels to the order in which they appear in the data, i.e. set the levels \u0026ldquo;as is\u0026rdquo; functions to write and read data frames to plain text delimited files while retaining factor levels; maybe by writing/reading a companion file?  Ideas for more powers functions to write:\n Maybe put another family of transforms via the Box-Cox transform. Maybe something related to logarithms (and/or Box-Cox inverses).  Ideas to add \u0026ldquo;wow\u0026rdquo; to your submission (to get beyond 90%)\n Add a family of related functions instead of just one Implement S3 object oriented functions Design your own package from scratch (for example, a data package like gapminder, or even simpler). \u0026hellip;  A note on plagiarism Because this assignment gets you to make some changes to an existing R package, presenting the final product in your own repo, we expect many aspects of your submission to be the same as the powers or foofactors repo.

Make sure your app actually works online (sometimes your app will work in RStudio but will have errors on shinyapps.io - make sure you deploy early and often to make debugging easier).\n Describe your app in your homework repository\u0026rsquo;s README, and add a link to the URL where the app is hosted.\n Include the code for your Shiny app in your homework repository, as the marker will need to review your code.\n Whatever dataset you will use, acknowledge its source clearly and extensively. Remember that we value open, reproducible science: this means that the user of your app should have direct access to the data, or know where to go to access it.\n  The Assignment We\u0026rsquo;ll leave it up to you to choose what three features you\u0026rsquo;d like to add to the app, but they must satisfy the following guidelines:\n There\u0026rsquo;s at least one new functional widget that modifies at least one output. There\u0026rsquo;s at least one change the ui (aside from the addition of a widget).  Possible features for the BC Liquor Store app. If you decide to create a new app, then you are free to do whatever you want - get creative! If you want to use the BC Liquor Store app, you need to add 3 new features to it. There are countless possibilities, but here are just a few ideas. Notice: you may want to read this and get inspired even if you\u0026rsquo;ll develop your own shiny app. You can choose any 3 or more ideas from this list or do anything else.\n Add an option to sort the results table by price.\n Hint: Use checkboxInput() to get TRUE/FALSE values from the user.  Add an image of the BC Liquor Store to the UI.\n Hint: Place the image in a folder named www, and use img(src = \u0026quot;imagename.png\u0026quot;) to add the image.  Use the DT package to turn the current results table into an interactive table.\n Hint: Install the DT package, replace tableOutput() with DT::dataTableOutput() and replace renderTable() with DT::renderDataTable().  Add parameters to the plot.\n Hint: You will need to add input functions that will be used as parameters for the plot. You could use shinyjs::colourInput() to let the user decide on the colours of the bars in the plot.  The app currently behaves strangely when the user selects filters that return 0 results. For example, try searching for wines from Belgium. There will be an empty plot and empty table generated, and there will be a warning message in the R console. Try to figure out why this warning message is appearing, and how to fix it.\n Hint: The problem happens because renderPlot() and renderTable() are trying to render an empty data frame. To fix this issue, the filtered reactive expression should check for the number of rows in the filtered data, and if that number is 0 then return NULL instead of a 0-row data frame.  Place the plot and the table in separate tabs.\n Hint: Use tabsetPanel() to create an interface with multiple tabs.  If you know CSS, add CSS to make your app look nicer.\n Hint: Add a CSS file under www and use the function includeCSS() to use it in your app.  Experiment with packages that add extra features to Shiny, such as shinyjs, leaflet, shinydashboard, shinythemes, ggvis.\n Hint: Each package is unique and has a different purpose, so you need to read the documentation of each package in order to know what it provides and how to use it.  Show the number of results found whenever the filters change. For example, when searching for Italian wines $20-$40, the app would show the text \u0026ldquo;We found 122 options for you\u0026rdquo;.\n Hint: Add a textOutput() to the UI, and in its corresponding renderText() use the number of rows in the filtered() object.  Allow the user to download the results table as a ..csv file.\n Hint: Look into the downloadButton() and downloadHandler() functions.  When the user wants to see only wines, show a new input that allows the user to filter by sweetness level. Only show this input if wines are selected.\n Hint: Create a new input function for the sweetness level, and use it in the server code that filters the data. Use conditionalPanel() to conditionally show this new input. The condition argument of conditionalPanel should be something like input.typeInput == \u0026quot;WINE\u0026quot;.  Allow the user to search for multiple alcohol types simultaneously, instead of being able to choose only wines/beers/etc.\n Hint: There are two approaches to do this. Either change the typeInput radio buttons into checkboxes (checkboxGroupInput()) since checkboxes support choosing multiple items, or change typeInput into a select box (selectInput()) with the argument multiple = TRUE to support choosing multiple options.  If you look at the dataset, you\u0026rsquo;ll see that each product has a \u0026ldquo;type\u0026rdquo; (beer, wine, spirit, or refreshment) and also a \u0026ldquo;subtype\u0026rdquo; (red wine, rum, cider, etc.). Add an input for \u0026ldquo;subtype\u0026rdquo; that will let the user filter for only a specific subtype of products. Since each type has different subtype options, the choices for subtype should get re-generated every time a new type is chosen. For example, if \u0026ldquo;wine\u0026rdquo; is selected, then the subtypes available should be white wine, red wine, etc.\n Hint: Use uiOutput() to create this input in the server code.  Provide a way for the user to show results from all countries (instead of forcing a filter by only one specific country).\n Hint: There are two ways to approach this. You can either add a value of \u0026ldquo;All\u0026rdquo; to the dropdown list of country options, you can include a checkbox for \u0026ldquo;Filter by country\u0026rdquo; and only show the dropdown when it is unchecked (see Dean\u0026rsquo;s version of this app to see this option in action). In both cases you\u0026rsquo;ll still need to update the server code appropriately to filter by country only when the user chooses to.

Your additions need to be tied to the existing pipeline \u0026ndash; i.e., the R and Rmd files that you add shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be stand-alone, or even stand-alone as a single unit. Your additions should correspond to some analysis \u0026ndash; that is, they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a nonsense addition to the pipeline, with nonsense outputs. They should have some meaning/purpose for an analysis. Be deliberate with your dependencies, output, and instructions in your Makefile:  Your Makefile should be written so that, if a dependency changes, running make should update the appropriate output (and all downstream portions of the pipeline). Running make all should result in having all output present in your repo. Running make clean should remove all output. There shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be any useless output, such as an Rplots.pdf file (which sometimes arises as a byproduct of running Rscript).   To form a tidy submission:\n Run the entire pipeline before submitting your assignment (so that all of the output is present and up-to-date with the latest version of your pipeline). Be sure to make it easy for the TA\u0026rsquo;s to know what you changed from the original pipeline. This is best put in the README file. A high level description is more appropriate here, especially because we can get the details of what you changed by looking at the commit history. Be sure to link to the original product that your homework repo was seeded with, as a way of recognizing that this original repo was not coded by you. This is especially important if your homework repo has any life outside of this course! As usual, your README should make it clear to a newcomer (who knows make, git, R, etc.) what\u0026rsquo;s going on in your repo.  Here are some suggestions:\n Although you don\u0026rsquo;t have to make your Rmd script rely on the output of your R script, this will probably make the most sense. Also, it might make the most sense for your addition to branch off close to the base of the existing pipeline, into another analysis. For example:  Have your R script take words.tsv as its input, and output a csv or tsv containing relevant data for your analysis. Take that csv/tsv file as input to your Rmd, which communicates the results.  Your analysis does not have to be groundbreaking or exciting. For example, maybe you want to explore whether there\u0026rsquo;s a relationship between the starting and ending letter of a word. Or perhaps you want to see which letters are most likely to appear repeated (next to each other) in a word. Your analysis doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be designed to justify the use of two files (R and Rmd) instead of just one. In fact, because we\u0026rsquo;re only asking you to do a small analysis, it will probably make the most sense (in any other context) to write the analysis in a single Rmd file. The point of using two files here is to give you practice with small examples, so that you\u0026rsquo;re better equipped to work with more complex analyses that would benefit from more than one file. Own your README! It\u0026rsquo;s yours to modify in whatever way you think is appropriate.  Above Expectations: \u0026ldquo;Wow\u0026rdquo; factors One way to convey \u0026ldquo;wow\u0026rdquo; for an extra 10% is to try things such as:\n Including scripts of different languages in your pipeline (such as python or LaTeX). Adding more phony targets besides clean and all \u0026ndash; especially if these phony targets correspond to something meaningful (perhaps make analysis1 / make analysis2 would be most relevant for this assignment). Making a pipeline from scratch to accomplish a different analysis. Making a graph of your pipeline, presented in your README \u0026ndash; especially if you can do this in an automated and reproducible way with some software.  There have been some attempts at making software to do this: makefile2dot, GraphViz::Makefile, j4make, makefile2graph.  Adding more structure to the project folder (perhaps folders such as data, src, doc, or others might be appropriate here?), created by automation where appropriate (with commands such as mkdir).  Note that one of these might not be enough for the full 10%, depending on how impactful it is on your overall submission.\nBelow Expectations: Partial Marks Having a hard time getting make working? You can still automate your pipeline with a \u0026ldquo;master R script\u0026rdquo;, like we saw in Class Meeting 09 with the LOTR pipeline Example 1. Use this instead of a Makefile, but make it clear in your README that this is what you\u0026rsquo;re doing.\nAssignments that make this adjustment to the expectations can still get 70%, still with the extra 10% room to add \u0026ldquo;wow\u0026rdquo;.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"565fd60446797f639d0d294f8e99cb31","permalink":"/evaluation/hw09/hw09/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/evaluation/hw09/hw09/","section":"evaluation","summary":"Homework 09: Automating Data-analysis Pipelines Overview The homework is due Tuesday, November 27, 2018, at 23:59.\nYour task, high level: modify the make activity pipeline we made in class.

The same is true for peer reviews: we\u0026rsquo;ll take the top four.\nYour task, high level: do scraping twice, and two API requests.\nIt would probably make the most sense to do the bulk of your work in an .Rmd file or two, but there are other methods that make sense.\nGetting Started As usual, create a homework repository by following the link provided on canvas.\nEvaluation All rubrics except the \u0026ldquo;graphs\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;tables\u0026rdquo; rubrics will be used to evaluate this assignment.\nThe scraping and API parts are weighted equally.\nHere are some ideas to add \u0026ldquo;wow\u0026rdquo; to your submission:\n Interact with an API more than just with GET. Maybe interact with your homework repo through the GitHub API (such as pushing and pulling). Maybe create an Issue through the GitHub API. The use of the gh package for this is totally acceptable. Use the RCurl package instead of / in addition to httr. Or, maybe even compare various methods of obtaining data (even between scraping and using an API on the same data). Would be really cool to see a \u0026ldquo;tutorial style\u0026rdquo; submission highlighting the differences between various methods. Make something like Andrew MacDonald\u0026rsquo;s gameday function, which upon using, gives you some real-time information about something. Maybe the weather? The news?  Note that the gameday function doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be working. The nhle website probably changed since its creation.   Keep in mind that doing things unrelated to the topic, although possibly wow\u0026rsquo;ing a reader, would not be worth additional marks. For example, doing a sentiment analysis on data you retrieve from Twitter would be great, but not worth anything extra in the context of this assignment.\nSubmitting Once you\u0026rsquo;re done the assignment, go back to UBC canvas, and find the \u0026ldquo;Homework 10\u0026rdquo; page. Here, do the following:\n Provide a link to your homework repository. Write a brief reflection about your experience with this assignment: what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc. No need to write lots here, this just allows us to make improvements for next year.  Although you don\u0026rsquo;t have to do this until the very end, we highly recommend you commit and push to your homework repo regularly!\nThe Assignment Scrape data Use the rvest package to scrape data from the web to make two data objects.\nRequirements:\n At least one of your data objects should be a data frame that contains at least 2 rows and 2 columns, and this should not be obtained from activities done in class. You should do some CSS selection (use html_nodes() or html_node()) in at least one case.  Make API queries Make two requests for data two make two data objects.\nRequirements:\n At least one of your data objects should be a data frame that contains at least 2 rows and 2 columns, and this should not be obtained from the GitHub API or the OMDb API that we used in class. Use the httr package to do the retrieval (or even the RCurl package if you\u0026rsquo;d like). Don\u0026rsquo;t use R packages that are specifically designed to wrap a specific API (such as rebird or geonames, as listed in the cm112 notes).  You can use these, but not until you\u0026rsquo;ve completed the original task. You can use the API\u0026rsquo;s associated with these, though.   Notes Privacy and security Remember to protect any API keys or tokens, if your chosen API requires them! Don\u0026rsquo;t commit and push those to GitHub. It might be best to leave a space early your script with a line like this:\nmy_api_key \u0026lt;- # Put API key here  Or perhaps have it read from a plain text file that you\u0026rsquo;ve .gitignored.\nAlso, make sure you not violating a site\u0026rsquo;s terms of service or your own ethical standards with your webscraping. Just because you can, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you should!\nOutput  The data that you read in, in all cases, should be in clean and tidy format. Store each data object as a file (eg. csv, tsv, txt) \u0026ndash; you should end up with four. In your report(s), do just enough basic exploration of the resulting data, possibly including some plots, that you and a reader are convinced you\u0026rsquo;ve successfully downloaded and cleaned it, and can get a good sense of what the data contains (without printing it to screen, unless it\u0026rsquo;s small, which is OK too). If there are many steps involved in wrangling the data, it might be useful to make it clear what the data looks like after it has just been read in, so that the downstream wrangling might be clearer. The data you retrieve should make sense with regards to a hypothetical analysis, or use-case. In other words, there should be some thought put into the type of data you retrieve, as opposed to just retrieving random nonsense.

We will be revisiting these over and over again.\n Embrace plain text. Source is real. Think in terms of source and output. Your analysis should be reproducible. Document, test, and leave a breadcrumb trail (version control), even when you are the only collaborator.   Conversation, and Getting Help Are you stuck? First, try to get unstuck by yourself by following the advice of stat545.com: help-general.\nWhile you are getting started, we recommend you seek help within the STAT545 community first, before, e.g. posting to external forums. We are more cuddly.\nThe instructor and TAs stand ready to assist you, but your peers will also be a great source of good questions and answers. For that reason, we encourage you to seek help in ways that are visible to others.\nThe options are sort of listed in order of preference. But we realize every situation is different and your comfort level with these approaches will change as you learn more.\nWant to talk about content/coding issues? Post an Issue in the Discussion (public) repository. Want to talk about the course? Post an Issue in the Discussion-Internal (private) repository. Want to talk in person? Come visit us during office hours! Want to privately contact Vincenzo? Feel free to send me an email.  I look forward to receiving your email, though I do encourage you to post in one of the Discussion repositories unless it’s really not appropriate for either platform.   Basic Issue workflow Some advice on opening an Issue on GitHub:\n Give it a specific title. BAD: “aaaaaarrrrrrgh!”, “things not working”, “i need help” GOOD: ‘error when indexing a matrix: “incorrect number of dimensions”’ Stay specific and be complete-but-concise in the body of the description. Don’t expect your helper to play 20 questions with you. (Optional) Tag someone:  To get the attention of the teaching team, add the @2018_teaching_team tag to notify all five of us.  Don’t just create Issues – also respond to them! Think about this in terms of adding to the conversation, not in terms of “correctness”. Don’t forget to click “Submit new issue”!  Typically, this will trigger an email to the person/team you tagged. The title of your issue will be in the subject line, so I repeat, make it specific. Your description will become the body of the email. At the bottom will be a link to the issue on GitHub.\nIf all goes well, your helper will respond. I almost always do this directly via GitHub, though simply replying to the email basically works. In any case, this back-and-forth will show up as a series of comments on your original issue. It’s like an email dialogue but better:\n It’s embedded in a relevant Organization/project/repo, so it will be easier to find later vs. digging out of your giant vat of unfiled email. It’s potentially visible to others (depending on the repo), which could save us from asking/answering the same questions repeatedly. The whole discussion will be mirrored via email, so that still serves as a great way to prompt participants to tune in. Later you can get fancy and refer to commits and other issues within the repo in slick ways.  Once the problem is resolved, the issue can be closed. Note that closed issues remain accessible, in case anyone needs to consult them in the future.\n  Annotated Resources Here are the resources we will be referring to throughout the course, along with a brief description of the resource.\nOverarching resources:\nhttp://stat545.com  As mentioned earlier, this website can be thought of as a textbook for STAT 545/547.  R for Data Science (aka “r4ds”), by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.  STAT 545/547 closely mirrors the topics of this book, making this book more of a true “textbook” for the course.   https://whattheyforgot.org/\nResources for more specific topics:\nHappy git with R, by Jenny Bryan and the STAT 545 TA’s  Great for marrying git, GitHub, R, and RStudio in your workflow.  Advanced R, by Hadley Wickham  If you want to learn more about R as a programming language, this is a very readable and concise way of doing so.  ggplot2 book, by Hadley Wickham  Useful for digging deeper into ggplot2.  RMarkdown book, by Yihui Xie et al.  Brand new! Looks like a comprehensive resource for everything R Markdown related.  R packages by Hadley Wickham  Readable, approachable help for making R packages.  Advanced R, by Hadley Wickham  If you want to learn more about R as a programming language, this is a very readable and concise way of doing so.   Repo that creates this website: https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io\nThe course organization on GitHub: https://github.com/STAT545-UBC\n Attribution Jenny Bryan deserves a huge amount of credit for founding and developing both STAT 545A and 547M over many years, along with her TA’s. Some of their content is even being used in this very syllabus.
