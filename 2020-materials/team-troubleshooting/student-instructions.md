## Team Troubleshooting Project

### Learning Objectives

1. Collaborate on a project with a partner using GitHub
2. Troubleshoot broken code
3. Rewrite code to address instructions

### Workflow

1. Create a group repository.
   + Name it GroupXX_STAT545. Your group number will be given to you at the start of the term, when you are given a partner.
   + Create a README outlining the purpose of the repo.
   + Create a teamwork contract where you establish a code of conduct and expectations, including:
     + Internal deadlines (for you and your partner) to push new commits prior to the course deadline.
     + Days in which it is expected that each partner will reply to the other's comments and/or pull requests.
     + Workflow for completing each worksheet - will each partner complete half of the worksheet? Or will you work together on multiple sections?

2. There will be three **milestones**, in the form of *Rmd deliverables* that will be provided to students. As an example, for **Milestone 1:**
   + Student A works on the deliverable and creates a pull request.
   + Student B comments on the pull request, initiates discussion, and continues working on the deliverable.
   + This continues until both students agree to merge the pull request.

3. A link to the last commit of the deliverable must be submitted to Canvas by the milestone deadline.

### Deadlines

**Add calendar or table here**.

### Grading scheme

+  The team troubleshooting project accounts for 35% of the total course grade.

+ Each milestone is graded as a group grade.
  + Each deliverable is graded out of 15 points (each error is 0.5 points).
  + Pull requests are graded out of 15 points, based on:
    + A good title and description. A good title is self-explanatory, and a good description clearly states *what* was changed in the pull request and *why*.
    + Productive discussion. Both students engaged in discussion in the pull request, and made changes to the document accordingly.

+ At the end of the project, each member will submit a quick evaluation of the other team members, and themselves. This evaluation is worth 10 points.
