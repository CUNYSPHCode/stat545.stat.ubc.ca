# STAT545-home

Repository that produces the new STAT 545 @ UBC website. Uses Hugo with the Academic theme, wrapped by blogdown, and hosted by netlify. 

Here are some noteworthy files and folders:

### `/content`

This is where the content of the website lives. Hugo/blogdown renders this to the `public` folder, which you don't need to touch.

### `config.toml` and `/config`

Website parameters used by Hugo are set in these `toml` files. 

### `/static`

Static stuff like pictures that the site draws on.

### `/history`

I'm using this folder to store historical information about the course, for the hopeful day of putting together some sort of "history" tab in the website.
