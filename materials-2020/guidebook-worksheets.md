## Introduction 

The purpose of this document is to **revise the [STAT545 guidebook](https://stat545guidebook.netlify.app/index.html)**, adapting the current material into lecture worksheets, pre-readings & videos, and in-class demos, in the form of a table that will be up in the STAT545 website and that will be the main point of access to materials for students.

+ Each "class meeting" will be reviewed, considering how the material will be repurposed into one of the following:

  i. Worksheet material - the section should be adapted to the worksheet format.
  
  ii. Video material / Pre-class work - the section should be adapted into a video or document for pre-reading material.
  
  iii. In-class demos - sections that are fit to be presented as a class demo.
  
  iiii. To remove - material that doesn't fit into the overall context of the worksheet.

+ Old worksheets linked to class meetings may also be reviewed *at a very high level* whenever relevant, making a few notes as to whether their activities could fit into the new lecture worksheets, just to ensure that this is kept in mind when the new worksheets are created.

### A few things to keep in mind when revising the guidebook

+ Lecture worksheets are designed to be completed **in-class**, with about 1 hour per worksheet allocated in a class. This should be taken into account when deciding the amount of guidebook material that can be transformed into a worksheet.

+ The guidebook is now **deprecated** but remains available, with each "worksheet" from previous years linked in each class - activities from these worksheets could also be reused in the new worksheets (with the *new* lecture worksheets ultimately being a mix of adapted guidebook material & old worksheet activities). 

## Class Meetings Revised

#### Action items



### Class Meeting 2: Git, GitHub & Version Control

#### Action items

+ Create document with instructions for in-class activities, but the only actual "deliverable" would be a link to their personal GitHub repo & to their main GitHub repo.
+ Decide on workflow for the collaborative troubleshooting project, which should be related to what they will do in class.

### Class Meeting 3: R Markdown & Reproducibility 

#### Action items

+ Remove the current section on presentations with Rmd, I don't think that many people use them and if they are not going to be used as a deliverable in any point of the course, I'm not sure that it's very relevant - maybe mention it, but not actually go through a demonstration or anything.
+ Create a "Class 3" section in Canvas with instructions for the adapted "asking effective questions online" activity (right now the link is to the old guidebook)
+ Decide if there is anything else that should be done as pre-work for this lecture? I did include the R Markdown tutorial, and I would encourage students to do that as pre-work too! (It's 10 minutes)

### Class Meeting 4: Data Wrangling I

#### Action items

+ Create lecture worksheet 2
+ Create a "Class 4" section in Canvas with pre-work: (1) History of tidyverse & dplyr. 
+ Anything else as prework? Maybe opening up a "discussion" section on Canvas where students are required to submit an entry / comment about something? Not sure what this would look like / the discussion topic, but this was often done during my Instructional Skills Workshop and it really helped build connection amongst students. Maybe can be as easy as "why are you taking this course / why are you interested in data science?", particularly seeing as this is the first class that everyone that is dropping the course will have done it already.

### Class Meeting 5: ggplot I

#### Action items

+ Create lecture worksheet 2
+ Create a "Class 5" section in Canvas with pre-work: (1) Intro to plotting in R: baseR > lattice > ggplot2 > plotly; (2) Maybe an activity that compares examples of bad vs. good plots, and students have to intuitively identify why some are better than others + maybe submit a comment on that? This would be a good intuitive intro prior to the grammar of graphics being introduced in class!; (3) "Choose your own adventure" poll for the 13th class topic!

### Class Meeting 6: Data wrangling II


#### Action items

+ Create lecture worksheet 3
+ Decide on pre-work
+ Create a "Class 6" section in Canvas with pre-work
