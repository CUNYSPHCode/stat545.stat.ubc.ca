# Welcome back to your mini data analysis project!

This time, we will explore more in depth the concept of *tidy data*, and hopefully investigate further into your research questions that you defined in milestone one.

Begin by loading your data and the tidyverse packagebelow: 

```{r}
library(datateachr) # <- contains the data you picked!
library(tidyverse)
```

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this milestone, you should:

+ Become familiar with manipulating and summarizing your data in tibbles using `dplyr`
+ Understand what *tidy* data is, when it is useful, and how to create it
+ Generate a reproducible and clear report using R Markdown

# Task 1: Process and summarize your data (20 points)

**Things to keep in mind**

+ Remember to document your code, be explicit about what you are doing, and write notes in this markdown document when you feel that context is required. Create your analysis as if someone else will be reading it! 

+ Before working on each task, you should always keep in mind the specific **research question** that you're trying to answer.

From milestone 1, you should have an idea of the basic structure of your dataset (e.g. number of rows and columns, class types, etc.). Here, we will start investigating your data more in-depth using various `dplyr` functions. 

1.1 First, write out the 4 research questions you defined in milestone 1 were. This will guide your work through milestone 2:

1. *FILL_THIS_IN*
2. *FILL_THIS_IN*
3. *FILL_THIS_IN*
4. *FILL_THIS_IN*

1.2 (15 points) Now, for each research question, complete 1 of the 8 operations described below. **Keep in mind that some of these will make more sense than others, depending on the research question!** For each of your chosen operation, you should explain why this operation *makes sense* and why the output helps answer the corresponding research question. Ensure that the output of each operation is printed! 

Options:
1. For one of the categorical variables in your data, compute the *range*, *mean*, and *two other summary statistics*.
2. Compute the number of observations for at least one of your categorical variables. Do not use the function `table()`!
3. Starting with a numerical variable, create a categorical variable with 3 or more groups. You can use this new variable in the other tasks!
4. Based on two categorical variables, calculate two summary statistics of your choosing.
5. Create a graph out of summarized variables that has at least two geom layers.
6. Create a graph of your choosing, make one of the axis logarithmic, and format the axis labels so that they are "pretty" or easier to read. 
7. Make a graph where it makes sense to customize the alpha transparency.
8. Create a 3 histograms out of summarized variables, with each histogram having a different sized bins. Pick the "best" one and explain why it is the best.

You should have one operation for each of your 4 research questions!

<!-- End of your work -->

1.3 (5 points) Based on the operations that you've completed, how much closer are you to answering your research questions? Think about what aspects of your research questions remain unclear. Can your research questions be refined, now that you've investigated your data a bit more? 

# Task 2: Tidy your data (10 points)

In this task, we will do several exercises to reshape our data. The goal here is to understand how to do this reshaping with the `tidyr` package.

A reminder of the definition of *tidy* data:

- Each row is an **observation**
- Each column is a **variable**
- Each cell is a **value**

Tidy'ing data is sometimes necessary because it can simplify computation. Other times it can be nice to organize data so that it can be read more easily. 

2.1 (5 points) Based on the definition above, can you identify if your data is tidy or untidy? Go through all your columns, or if you have >10 variables, just pick 10, and explain whether the data is untidy or tidy.

<!-- End of your work -->

2.2 (5 points) Now, if your data is tidy, untidy it! If it's untidy, then tidy it! Be sure to explain why your reasoning for this task.
