## Lecture 1

Breakout rooms on Day 1 to introduce yourself

+ Rather than using breakout rooms in the first class (since it may be the first time using R and RStudio for many), I think alternating between an in-class demo where everything in [2.5 Orientation to R](https://stat545guidebook.netlify.app/introduction-to-r.html) & "don't save your workspace" is demonstrated while alternating with students completing the worksheet may be good. 
+ Example of the workflow (1) Vincenzo demonstrates Functions I and Functions II, could simply be an improvised demo in R (2) Students complete the relevant section of the worksheet, and click "yes" on Zoom when they are done (3) When all or almost all students have clicked "yes" (if there is a couple that have not, TAs reach out directly to ask), go on to the next task.

## Git lecture

Lecture last year on git felt boring. It would be better to just work with lots of examples, because people really get stuck when their local and remote diverge. Also, people leave files uncommitted, and end up with many files in their git tab. Would also be useful to demonstrate the "burn it all down" approach.

Go through exercises in Guidebook (perhaps move them to their own document visible to the students?)

- 1.5.3, 1.5.5, 4.2.3, 4.2.6
- PR, as in https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ -- also 4.2.8
