## Lecture 1

Breakout rooms on Day 1 to introduce yourself

## Git lecture

Lecture last year on git felt boring. It would be better to just work with lots of examples, because people really get stuck when their local and remote diverge. Also, people leave files uncommitted, and end up with many files in their git tab. Would also be useful to demonstrate the "burn it all down" approach.
