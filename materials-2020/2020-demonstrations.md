## Lecture 1

Breakout rooms on Day 1 to introduce yourself

+ Rather than using breakout rooms in the first class (since it may be the first time using R and RStudio for many), I think alternating between an in-class demo where everything in [2.5 Orientation to R](https://stat545guidebook.netlify.app/introduction-to-r.html) & "don't save your workspace" is demonstrated while alternating with students completing the worksheet may be good. 
+ Example of the workflow (1) Vincenzo demonstrates Functions I and Functions II, could simply be an improvised demo in R (2) Students complete the relevant section of the worksheet, and click "yes" on Zoom when they are done (3) When all or almost all students have clicked "yes" (if there is a couple that have not, TAs reach out directly to ask), go on to the next task.
