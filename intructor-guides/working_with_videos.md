## Add closed captioning to recorded lecture

If the following steps aren't detailed enough, for further help self-enroll into the 'Using Kaltura in Canvas' course https://canvas.ubc.ca/enroll/FFTMNN and go through Module 9: Ordering, Viewing and Editing Captions

NOTE:  Depending on the length of the recording and the clarity of the speaker, editing the captions could potentially be a very time consuming process.  However, if the speaker talks slowly and clearly enough so that every word is clear and the end of each sentence is obvious, then this will greatly reduce the amount of editing of words and punctuation.

8. Select Captions and then click the Edit Captions button which will open up the Closed Captions Editor

## Some general but helpful information

My Media is a collection of all the videos you've recorded or uploaded with the Kaltura tools. This is your complete library of videos. It's associated with your Canvas account, but not with any particular course. Your students in a given course cannot see what's in your My Media collection.

Media Gallery is the place, within a Canvas course, where you can choose and post videos from your My Media collection for your students to view.  Those videos in My Media that are relevantto course and posted in the course's Media Gallery allow students to access them all in one place.

A published video in My Media can be embedded in any Canvas course without it being in the course's Media Gallery.  And doing this will not automatically add it to the course's Media Gallery.
