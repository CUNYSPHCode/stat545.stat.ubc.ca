# Teamwork Contract 2020

Let's use this document to write down how we all hope to work together.

- Rotate administrative roles. 
- Use Asana to organize action items.
    - We all have the authority to update this list as needed.
- Weekly meeting to discuss tasks and any questions.
- Start the course with ad-hoc, weekly division of labour.
- Let Vincenzo know if you ever feel that you are working too hard (more than 12 hours per week) -- we can figure something out.
