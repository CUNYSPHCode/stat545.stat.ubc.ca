## The Assignment Life Cycle

Here is the general flow that will happen for the assignments.

1.  When an assignment is released, I will post a GitHub Issue in the [Announcements](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-hw-2019-20/Announcements) repo, tagging the teaching team and students (you should get an email notification, too, unless you've (1) somehow disabled this, (2) are not `Watch`ing the `Announcements` repo, or (3) did not inform me of your GitHub username).
2.  Develop your homework responses on your homework repository (see below)
3.  Upon completion of your assignment, it would be useful for you to submit a link to your URL in the UBC Canvas page. We will be putting your grades there.

## Making your homework repo

## How your assignments are graded

**MAY CHANGE FOR 2019/2020**

Components of each assignment will be graded on a 3-point scale. Here is the general rubric (*also consult any specific guidance given in the relevant assignment itself*).

Topic| Excellent: 3 | Satisfactory: 2 | Needs work: 1 |
|----| ------ |-------| -----|
|Coding style| Student has gone beyond what was expected and required, coding manual is followed, code is well commented | Coding style lacks refinement and has some errors, but code is readable and has some comments | Many errors in coding style, little attention paid to making the code human readable|
|Coding strategy| Complicated problem broken down into sub-problems that are individually much simpler. Code is efficient, correct, and minimal. Code uses appropriate data structure (list, data frame, vector/matrix/array). Code checks for common errors  | Code is correct, but could be edited down to leaner code. Some "hacking" instead of using suitable data structure. Some checks for errors. |   Code tackles complicated problem in one big chunk. Code is repetitive and could easily be functionalized. No anticipation of errors. |
|Presentation: graphs | Graph(s) carefully tuned for desired purpose. One graph illustrates one point | Graph(s) well chosen, but with a few minor problems: inappropriate aspect ratios, poor labels. | Graph(s) poorly chosen to support questions. |
|Presentation: tables | Table(s) carefully constructed to make it easy to perform important comparisons. Careful styling highlights important features. | Table(s) generally appropriate but possibly some minor formatting deficiencies.| Table(s) with too many, or inconsistent, decimal places. Table(s) not appropriate for questions and findings. Major display problems.|
|Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity|Student has gone beyond what was expected and required, e.g., extraordinary effort, additional tools not addressed by this course, unusually sophisticated application of tools from course.|Tools and techniques from the course are applied very competently and, perhaps,somewhat creatively. Chosen task was acceptable, but fairly conservative in ambition.|Student does not display the expected level of mastery of the tools and techniques in this course. Chosen task was too limited in scope.|
|Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work|Access as easy as possible, code runs! | Satisfactory | Not an earnest effort to reduce friction and comply with conventions  and/or code does not run|
