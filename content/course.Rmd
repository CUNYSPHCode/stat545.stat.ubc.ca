# Projects

You will be working on various projects on GitHub repositories within a GitHub Organization setup for this course. Some general things you should know:

**How to followup with a project submission**

You'll be given feedback as an Issue in your project repository, sometimes before your grade is posted.

- Make sure you're `Watch`ing your repository, so that you will be notified by email whenever a new Issue or comment is posted -- you can find this option in the upper-rigth hand corner of your repository page.
- You can use the Issue thread to have a conversation about your assignment results. 
- If you would like to dispute your grade, this Issue thread is the place to do it, but please do so only within 1 week after the grade has been posted.
