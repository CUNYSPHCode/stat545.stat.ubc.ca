## Student-facing worksheets

To put a new worksheet here:

1. Write the worksheet on the [`stat-545-instructor` repo](https://github.com/ubc-stat/stat-545-instructor).
2. Still in the instructor's repo, generate the student-facing ("release") version of the worksheet using nbgrader.
3. Copy the "release" version over to this very folder.
