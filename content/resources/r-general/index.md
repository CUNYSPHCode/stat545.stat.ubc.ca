### One last thing

The R universe is permanently expanding, and with so many awesome people contributing to create new packages & resources, it's hard to keep up with everything that is going on. To find out what's happening in R, here are a few things that you can do:

+ Follow the "#rstats" feed on Twitter! You'll find fantastic accounts to follow, and with an ever flowing source of information, it's almost guaranteed that you'll learn something new pretty often.

+ Not on social media? Not to worry. Maelle Salmon collected several different [ways to keep up with R news](https://masalmon.eu/2019/01/25/uptodate/), some through social media, but also through podcasts [The R podcast](https://r-podcast.org/) and newsletters such as [R Weekly](https://rweekly.org/).
