+ [**GitHub Guides**](https://guides.github.com/) has lots of info about GitHub. If you do go here, I recommend you start with [“Hello, World!”](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).
+ [**Getting started with git**](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html) is a good place to get started with Git, which is different from GitHub, and manages the evolution of your files - what is known as [version control](https://www.r-bloggers.com/beyond-basic-r-version-control-with-git/). 
+ Some thought should be given to your [**github username**](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html#username-advice).
+ There are [many types of **github accounts**](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/types-of-github-accounts). 
+ To master Github, you shall master [**issues**](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/), a collaborative way of tracking tasks and changes to your project.
+ And to master the styling of your GitHub documents, here is a [Markdown cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf). Markdown is a way to style documents on the web.
+ The [**Github Student Developer Pack**](https://education.github.com/pack) is a brilliant set of developer tool freebies for students that you won't want to miss.
+ Lastly, the complete guide to thrive in GitHub and Git, [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/), by Jenny Bryan. 
+ Want to share your GitHub repository with the world? [**Make it into a website**](https://pages.github.com/) with GitHub pages.
