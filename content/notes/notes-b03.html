<div id="test-your-understanding" class="section level2">
<h2>Test Your Understanding</h2>
<p>Use these questions to check your understanding of the material.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>True or False: You’ve opened Terminal, and are now about to run <code>Rscript</code> for a second time. Because you haven’t restarted the Terminal, the code will continue to build in the same session as before.</li>
<li>You have information in <code>script1.R</code> that you’d like to pass to <code>scipt2.R</code>. True or false: the best way to pass the info to <code>script2.R</code> is by saving the final workspace from <code>script1.R</code> in an <code>.RData</code> or <code>.rds</code> file, and loading that it into <code>script2.R</code>.</li>
<li>True or False: It’s almost always better to write an <code>.Rmd</code> file over an <code>.R</code> file, because you’re able to interlace markdown.</li>
<li>True or false: <code>make</code>ing a <em>phony</em> target will always run its rules, whereas <code>make</code>ing a target <em>file</em> will only run its rules if the output needs updating.</li>
<li>True or false: If a dependency file is not present on your computer, you can still call <code>make</code> error-free if the dependency is the target of another rule. This is true even if the dependency never gets made.</li>
<li>True or false: The rules to <code>make</code> a target file will be run if either the target file or the dependencies are modified.</li>
<li>True or false: Dependencies in <code>make</code> are accessed “lazily”, so that if the dependencies are never actually used when executing a rule, they don’t actually have any impact on the Makefile.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Demonstration</h2>
<div id="multi-file-analyses" class="section level3">
<h3>Multi-file analyses</h3>
<p>It’s often not a good idea to write an analysis in a single R/Rmd script, especially if the analysis has multiple steps to it. Here are a few benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>You won’t have to run upstream calculations (like data processing / cleaning) every time you run the script. Instead, write a script to process the data, and write the output to file.</li>
<li>If your analysis branches into different explorations, you’ll have to run irrelevant computations each time (and those computations may be a source of error).</li>
<li>You’re less likely to end up with an overloaded workspace.</li>
<li>People can mentally compartmentalize the analysis into several tasks, making the analysis more understandable and easier to debug.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no single ideal way to organize your files. But you might want to include folders like these:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>data</code>: Usually holds the raw data, which is not meant to be modified ever.</li>
<li><code>src</code>: Holds files containing R code to do the analysis.</li>
<li><code>output</code> or <code>img</code>: Folder containing outputs of the analysis, sometimes just images.</li>
</ul>
<p>Always include a README explaining:</p>
<ul>
<li>what the analysis is about (orient a visitor),</li>
<li>how to engage with the analysis (explore files and run code), and</li>
<li>what dependencies are required to run the analysis (a list of R packages, and the version of R you’re running – use <code>R.version</code>).
<ul>
<li>Useful to use a package manager or Docker – not explored in this course.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<div id="non-interactive-programming-batch-processing" class="section level3">
<h3>Non-interactive programming (batch processing)</h3>
<p>When we write R code, we usually do so <em>interactively</em>: we run bits and pieces as we write it. But, when you’re done adding code to a script (for now), it’s useful to run that script <em>non-interactively</em>, or in “batch mode”. You can think of this as running a script from top-to-bottom from a clean slate.</p>
<p>You’ve done this before: when you click “knit” in RStudio to knit an .Rmd file, you’re running that .Rmd file non-interactively. But if you want to orchestrate and run multiple files, it gets tiresome to click “knit” on the files, and in the correct order. Instead, run a file from the Terminal / command line using the <code>Rscript</code> command.</p>
<p>Here’s a summary of the commands you’ll need to run a file non-interactively, comparing both from R and from Terminal:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="37%" />
<col width="21%" />
<col width="40%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>file</th>
<th>From R</th>
<th>From Terminal</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>script.R</code></td>
<td><code>source("script.R")</code> or “source” button in RStudio</td>
<td><code>Rscript script.R</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>report.Rmd</code></td>
<td><code>rmarkdown::render("report.Rmd")</code> or “knit” button in RStudio</td>
<td><code>Rscript -e 'rmarkdown::render("report.Rmd")'</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Notice that there isn’t actually a way to build an .Rmd file from the Terminal directly, so we have to use the <code>-e</code> tag, which executes R code that follows within quotation marks.</p>
<p>Benefits of running code non-interactively:</p>
<ul>
<li>The only real way to ensure your work is reproducible.</li>
<li>Like a conductor, focus on higher-level computation of different tasks without having to go into each script and manually run the code.</li>
<li>Gain access to cloud computing services like Amazon AWS.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that opening RStudio starts a <em>session</em> of R, a single “brain” that you send commands to – even across files. But, each non-interactive run of a script is self-contained – except the <code>source()</code> function, which runs code in the active R session.</p>

<div id="command-line" class="section level3">
<h3>Command line</h3>
<p>We’ll review the following bash commands/features:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rm</code></li>
<li><code>cd</code></li>
<li><code>ls</code></li>
<li>tags with <code>-</code></li>
<li>help with <code>--help</code></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="makefiles" class="section level3">
<h3>Makefiles</h3>
<p>With multiple files, how can you keep track of running the files in the right order? Or, running only the parts of your analysis that needs updating? That’s where Makefiles come in handy. The software <code>make</code> reads this and executes parts of the analysis that needs executing.</p>
<p>Each block of code in a Makefile is called a rule, it looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>file_to_create: files.it depends.on like_this.R
    code to be run in the command line
    that can have multiple lines of code
    Rscript like_this.R</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>file_to_create</code> is a target, a file to be created, or built.</li>
<li><code>files.it</code>, <code>depends.on</code>, and <code>like_this.R</code> are dependencies, files which are needed to build or update the target. Targets can have zero or more dependencies.</li>
<li><code>:</code> separates targets from dependencies.</li>
<li><code>code to be run in the command line</code>, …, <code>Rscript like_this.R</code> are actions, commands to run to build or update the target using the dependencies. Targets can have zero or more actions. Actions are indented using the TAB character, not spaces.</li>
<li>Together, the target, dependencies, and actions form a rule.</li>
</ul>
<p>When will a rule be run?</p>
<ul>
<li>If the target is not present in your folder, or</li>
<li>If a dependency is newer than the target file.</li>
</ul>
<div id="makefile-activity" class="section level4">
<h4>Makefile activity</h4>
<p>We’ll demo the process of building up to makefile for a simple directory structure that involves processing raw data and making some plots out of the raw data.</p>
<p>Another good resource is the <a href="https://stat545.com/automating-pipeline.html">makefile activity</a> included in the stat545.com book.</p>

<div id="running-r-in-the-background" class="section level3">
<h3>Running R in the background</h3>
<p>Sometimes you’ll write an R script that takes a long time to run. You’d like to start the execution of the code, go to bed, and wake up to freshly computed output. To run <code>script.R</code> and record a log of the things you’d normally see when you run code interactively in a file called <code>log.out</code>, run this code:</p>
<pre><code>nohup Rscript script.R &gt; log.out 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/2012/01/long-running-r-commands-unix-screen-nohup-and-r/">This R-Bloggers post</a> explains this command well, but here’s a breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>nohup</code> sends the code execution to the background.</li>
<li><code>&gt; log.out 2&gt;&amp;1</code> directs output and messages to <code>log.out</code>.</li>
<li>The final <code>&amp;</code> frees up your terminal</li>
</ul>
<p>Just be careful to get the directory of the files right.</p>
