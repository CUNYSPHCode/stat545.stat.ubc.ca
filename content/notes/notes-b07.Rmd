One great thing about having html files output from Rmd? We can use Rmd as a framework for creating websites, because websites are often just html.

From this topic, students are anticipated to be able to:

- Use the blogdown R package to create a template website.
- Explore themes; particularly, hugo academic (now called wowchemy).
- Host your website using GitHub Pages.

This topic is optional, and very short. 

## Demonstration

1. Install blogdown.

You'll first need to install blogdown with `install.packages("blogdown")`.

2. Make a new project.

In RStudio:

_File -> New Project ... -> New Directory -> Website using blogdown:_

_Under the "Hugo theme", we'll use the theme `wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic`_

What's "Hugo"? What's this "theme" all about?

- Hugo is the website generator. Blogdown doesn't actually make websites, Hugo does. Blogdown is just a wrapper that helps us use Hugo.
- Hugo is theme-specific. Once you learn how to make a website using a theme, if you want to switch to another theme, you'll have to re-learn how to make the website (although some concepts are transferable).
    - See the [documentation for Hugo Academic / Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/docs/)

3. Check out the website.

In your console, run `blogdown::serve_site()`.

4. Try modifying things.

- Check out the "widgets" on the homepage (see a list of widgets [on the documentation here](https://wowchemy.com/docs/getting-started/page-builder/).)
- Modify the TOML files (which are like YAML).
- Modify some content.


## More Information

There's a definitive [book called "blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown"](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).

- Use their [quick example](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/a-quick-example.html) as an alternative quick-start guide to the one we provide above -- this time using Yihui Xie's "Hugo Lithium" theme (which is simpler than wowchemy).

- Use the entire book to learn more about the details of blogdown.
