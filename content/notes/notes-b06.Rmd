## Learning Objectives

From today's class, students are anticipated to be able to:

- Manipulate a character vector in R using the stringr package.
- Write simple regular expressions (regex).
- Apply stringr and regular expressions to manipulate data in tibbles.

## Parallel Resources

This topic parallels these resources:

- STAT 545 Episode (future resource)
- Similar overview tutorials:
    - [stat545.com Chapter 11: character vectors](https://stat545.com/character-vectors.html)
    - [R4DS Chapter 14: strings](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html).

I suggest digesting this material before class, or at least throughout our discussion of the topic.

## Additional Resources

The stat545.com Chapter 11 on character vectors [has an elaborate discussion on useful resources](https://stat545.com/character-vectors.html#resources-3) for learning more about strings. 

## Quiz

Use these questions to check your understanding of the material.

**NOTE**: No canvas submission is required for Class 12-B.

1. True or False: The regular expression `[ab][ab]` will match "ab", "aa", and "bb" as possibilities, whereas `[ab]{2}` will only match "aa" or "bb".
2. True or False: The regular expression `[ab][ab]` will match "ab", "aa", and "bb" as possibilities, whereas `(ab)(ab)` will only match "aa" or "bb".
3. True or False: The regular expression `^ab` will match "ab" as the first characters to a string, whereas `[^ab]` will match "a" or "b" as being the first character to a string.

## Demonstration

Today:

1. Work on Worksheet 3-B, "Part 1: Manipulating strings"
2. Explore regex in the demo below.
3. Continue Worksheet 3-B, "Part 2: Regex"

__Note that re*g*ex is different from re*pr*ex!__ They sound the same, but are very different things:

- re*pr*ex = reproducible example.
- re*g*ex = regular expression.

reprex:

```
reprex::reprex({
    x <- 5
    x * 2
})
#> Rendering reprex...
#> Rendered reprex is on the clipboard.
```

regex:

```
"STAT 545[A|B].*"
```
