## Learning Objectives

From today's class, students are anticipated to be able to:

- Manipulate a character vector in R using the stringr package.
- Write simple regular expressions (regex).
- Apply regular expressions to data manipulation.

## Parallel Resources

This topic parallels these resources:

- STAT 545 Episode (future resource)
- Similar overview tutorials:
    - [stat545.com Chapter 11: character vectors](https://stat545.com/character-vectors.html)
    - [R4DS Chapter 14: strings](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html).

I suggest digesting this material before class, or at least throughout our discussion of the topic.

## Additional Resources

The stat545.com Chapter 11 on character vectors [has an elaborate discussion on useful resources](https://stat545.com/character-vectors.html#resources-3) for learning more about strings. 

## Outline

Today, we'll work on Worksheet 3-B, on strings and regular expressions.
