Is something not working? Need help? Try following these steps.

## 1. Try to help yourself

[Google is your friend](http://xkcd.com/627/). Google is your friend. Google is your friend.
  
E.g. copy the error message, maybe strip out anything highly specific, such the name of your R objects, surround with quotes and Google it!

One commonly landed on site is [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) -- tremendously helpful.

## 2. Make a minimally reproducible example

Still stuck? Time to **prepare** to post a question on the STAT 545 Slack `#general` channel by making a [_minimally reproducible example_](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). Basically, the example should specify both what you _did_ to get the error (or unexpected result), as well as _specifying what the error_ is, **in a way that cuts out everything else that's not relevant to the problem**.


Even better, use the `reprex()` function from the reprex package (FYI: "reprex" is a portmanteau of the words _reproducible example_). For example, try running the following reprex containing an erroneous use of the `summarise()` function. The output of the interior code will be placed on your clipboard, which you can then paste into Slack, along with your question. 

``` r
reprex::reprex({
  library(dplyr)
  library(gapminder)
  gapminder %>% 
    summarise(mean == mean(lifeExp))
})
```

This stackoverflow thread ["How to make a great R reproducible example?"](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example/5963610#5963610) is fantastic. I find that, in the process of preparing my great reproducible example, I answer my own question 90% of the time. YMMV. So it is a useful exercise even if you aren't ready to call in the experts yet. The process of stripping your problem down to its bare essence often reveals where the root issue lies. __Highly recommended!__

## 3. Post a question on Slack

If you're still stuck after making your minimally reproducible example, then post your minimally reproducible example to the STAT 545 Slack `#general` channel. 

- Show your code and the output, ideally using the `reprex()` function (see above section), along with your question. No code involved? Then...
- Take a screenshot of the unexpected output, and if relevant, the action that caused it, along with your question. Nothing to screenshot? Then...
- Describe in words what the unexpected results are, and what actions led to the unexpected results, along with your question.

Here is an example of making a post with the help of the reprex function. I wrote my question, then pasted the stuff that running the `reprex()` function placed on my clipboard:

> I keep getting an error when trying to calculate a mean in the `summarise()` function. Here is a reprex:

#>     filter, lag
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
library(gapminder)
gapminder %>% 
  summarise(mean == mean(lifeExp))
#> Error: Problem with `summarise()` input `..1`.
#> x comparison (1) is possible only for atomic and list types
#> â„¹ Input `..1` is `mean == mean(lifeExp)`.

## 4. Posting a question on external forums

When you move on beyond STAT 545, there are external forums like [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) where you can post your questions. There is an expectation in the community that those seeking help must ask for help in an effective way. 

If you'd like more advice on asking questions effectively, check out the following. 

* Check out [The R Inferno](http://www.burns-stat.com/documents/books/the-r-inferno/) (see the 9th circle: "Unhelpfully seeking help").
  
  > If someone has the wit and knowledge to answer your question, they probably have other things they would like to do. Making your message clear, concise and user-friendly gives you the best hope of at least one of those strangers diverting their attention away from their life towards your problem.
  
* Read [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric Raymond and Rick Moen. You'll need a slightly thick skin, but they speak truth.
  
  > ... demonstrate the kind of attitude that leads to competence: alert, thoughtful, observant, willing to be an active partner in developing a solution
  
* Read the [R-help posting guide](http://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html). *But don't rush to post any questions there!*
