<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>From this topic, students are anticipated to be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>recognize whether a given dataset is ‘tidy’ or ‘untidy’</li>
<li>understand why ‘tidy’ data is useful</li>
<li>reshape a dataset between a ‘long’ and ‘wide’ format, using <code>tidyr::pivot_longer()</code> and <code>tidyr::pivot_wider()</code></li>
<li>deal with missing data in a tibble</li>
</ul>
<p>We will spend two days on this topic.</p>

<p>Suppose that we want to visualize changes in the turbuculosis disease rate over time. The difficulty of this task varies depending on which of the four representations you use.</p>
<p>In other words: the four tables above are not equally easy to use for this data analysis task!</p>

<h3>Another example</h3>
<p>Let us return to the WHO tuberculosis data, where we decided that we wanted to visualize changes in the turbuculosis disease rate over time. We will first tackle this with <code>table1</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>table1 %&gt;% mutate(rate=cases/population) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=rate, colour=country)) + 
  geom_line() + geom_point() + xlab(&quot;Year&quot;) + ylab(&quot;TB Rate&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/notes/notes-a08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We will now tackle this with <code>table2</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Extract number of cases per country per year 
# and population per country per year
table2_cases_only &lt;- table2 %&gt;% filter(type == &quot;cases&quot;)
table2_pop_only &lt;- table2 %&gt;% filter(type == &quot;population&quot;)

# Make sure that the tables match!! 
table2_cases_only$country == table2_pop_only$country</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>table2_cases_only$year == table2_pop_only$year</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># For each country and year, divide the cases by population
# to compute rate 
tb_rate_table &lt;- table2_cases_only %&gt;% 
  mutate(rate=count/table2_pop_only$count)

tb_rate_table %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=year, y=rate, colour=country)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + xlab(&quot;Year&quot;) + ylab(&quot;TB Rate&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/notes/notes-a08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The <code>table2</code> approach is more involved than the <code>table1</code> approach.</p>
<p>We can make this difference in effort even more pronounced by introducing missing data. The following code modifies <code>table1</code> and <code>table2</code> so that the the population count for the year 1999 in Afghanistan is missing:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>(table1_missing &lt;- table1 %&gt;% 
   mutate(population = case_when(
     (country==&quot;Afghanistan&quot; &amp; year == 1999) ~ NA_integer_,
     TRUE ~ as.integer(population))
     )
 )</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 × 4

<pre class="r"><code>(table2_missing &lt;- table2 %&gt;% 
    filter(!(country==&quot;Afghanistan&quot; &amp; year == 1999))
  )</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 10 × 4
##    country      year type            count
##    &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;int&gt;

<h3>Step 1: What are the underlying variables and observations?</h3>
<p>Step 1 is to figure out what the underlying variables and observations are. This might seem straightforward, but it can be surprisingly hard because it <strong>depends on the (scientific and statistical) question being asked</strong>.</p>
<div id="example-great-british-bakeoff" class="section level4">
<h4>Example: Great British Bakeoff</h4>
<p>We will demonstrate using data from “The Great British Bake Off” compiled by <a href="https://www.apreshill.com/">Allison Hill</a> in the R package <code>bakeoff</code>. (Note that this package is not hosted on CRAN, so if you would like to install it, you will need to run <code>install.packages("remotes")</code> then type <code>remotes::install_github("apreshill/bakeoff")</code> into R.) The graphics that follow (and the code to produce the graphics) were lightly adapted from Allison’s <a href="https://www.apreshill.com/talk/2019-rladies-sydney/">Plot Twist talk</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a bar plot of the number of viewers in millions within a 7-day window per episode, coloured by series.</p>
<p><img src="/notes/notes-a08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This bar plot was constructed with the following tidy data representation:</p>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 × 4
##   ep_id viewers_7day series episode
##   &lt;int&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1     1         2.24      1       1
## 2     2         3         1       2
## 3     3         3         1       3
## 4     4         2.6       1       4
## 5     5         3.03      1       5
## 6     6         2.75      1       6</code></pre>
<p>Every row is an observation (a unique episode), and the columns are variables (a continuous episode number across series, 7-day viewership, series, and episode number within series).</p>
<p>Here is another bar plot displaying percentage increase in the number of viewers in millions within a 7-day window from the premiere episode to finale episode for the first 10 series.</p>
<p><img src="/notes/notes-a08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Notice that our observations and variables are not the same as before! Here, our observations are <em>series</em>, and our variables are <em>the number of viewers in millions within a 7-day window for the first and last episode of each series</em>. Given these two variables, we could calculate the variable displayed in the bar plot (the percentage increase in viewers from the premiere to finale) with the logic <code>(last-first)/first</code>.</p>
<p>In other words, the tidy data representation is this wider format:</p>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 × 3
##   series first  last
##   &lt;fct&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 1       2.24  2.75
## 2 2       3.1   5.06

<p>The moral of the story: what is “tidy” can differ within <strong>the exact same data set</strong>. This is because what is an observation and what is a variable depends on the scientific/statistical question being asked!</p>
<p>Once again, we return to the words of the great philosopher Aretha Franklin …</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You better think (think) about what you’re trying to do …” - Aretha Franklin, “Think”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A general rule of thumb:</p>
<ul>
<li>It feels more natural to think about functional relationships between variables (e.g. <code>pct_change</code> is <code>(last-first)/first</code>) than between observations.<br />
</li>
<li>It feels more natural to compare groups of observations (e.g. average viewership across all episodes in series 1 vs average viewership across all episodes in series 2) than between groups of variables.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 2: Pivot or Separate/Unite</h3>
<p>In Step 1, we decided what the underlying variables and observations are. In Step 2, we will produce the corresponding tidy representation. This will virtually always involve <strong>pivoting</strong> and/or <strong>separating/uniting</strong> your data.</p>
<div id="pivoting" class="section level4">
<h4>Pivoting</h4>
<p>The <code>tidyr</code> package is loaded with the <code>tidyverse</code> and provides functions for pivoting data. It has two main “pivoting” type functions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>pivot_longer()</code> makes datasets <em>longer</em> by increasing the number of rows and decreasing the number of columns.</li>
<li><code>pivot_wider()</code> makes datasets <em>wider</em> by decreasing the number of rows and increasing the number of columns.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that pivoting used to be achieved through the tidyr <code>spread()</code> and <code>gather()</code> functions. These are now deprecated and should not be used. They are only kept along with the tidyr package for backward compatibility.</p>
<p>Think back to our WHO Tuberculosis example from the very beginning. This was our tidy representation:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>table1</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 × 4
##   country      year  cases population

## 2 Afghanistan  2000   2666   20595360
## 3 Brazil       1999  37737  172006362

<p>This was one of our untidy representations:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>table2</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 12 × 4

<p>Compared to <code>table1</code>, <code>table2</code> is too long - <code>table2</code> has spread a single observation (case counts and population counts for a single country in a single year) across multiple rows.</p>
<p>We can solve this problem using <code>pivot_wider</code>, which needs two pieces of information. We are going to increase the number of columns, so …</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What should the new columns be named? Put the name of the column you want to take the new variable names from in the <code>names_from</code> argument.</p></li>
<li><p>What values should the new columns contain? Put the name of the column you want to take the values from to <code>values_from</code> in the <code>values_from</code> argument.</p></li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>table2 %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from=type, 
                       values_from = count)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 × 4

## 5 China        1999 212258 1272915272
## 6 China        2000 213766 1280428583</code></pre>
<p>This was another (part of) one of our untidy representations:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>table4a</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 3 × 3
##   country     `1999` `2000`
## * &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;int&gt;  &lt;int&gt;
## 1 Afghanistan    745   2666
## 2 Brazil       37737  80488
## 3 China       212258 213766</code></pre>
<p>Compared to <code>table1</code>, <code>table4a</code> is too wide. One way to see this is to identify our observational unit (a single country in a single year) and observe that there are fewer rows than there are observational units. Perhaps a more direct way to see it is to notice that we want <code>year</code> to be a variable, and the column names actually contain <em>values</em> of that variable!</p>
<p>We can solve this problem using <code>pivot_longer</code>, which needs three pieces of information. We are going to decrease the number of columns, so …</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Which are the offending columns that we want to combine? Put their names in the <code>cols</code> argument.</p></li>
<li><p>These column names are often important though - so we should save them as values in a column of our new data set. What should the name of that column be? Put it in the <code>names_to</code> argument.</p></li>
<li><p>What should we name the column in our new data set that contains the values in the offending columns of the old data set? Put it in the <code>values_to</code> argument.</p></li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>table4a %&gt;% pivot_longer(c(`1999`, `2000`), 
                         names_to = &quot;year&quot;, 
                         values_to = &quot;cases&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 × 3
##   country     year   cases

## 6 China       2000  213766</code></pre>
<p>Note that to fully recreate <code>table1</code>, we will need to pivot <code>table4b</code> too, and then combine the pivoted version of <code>table4b</code> with the pivoted version of <code>table4a</code>. We will talk about how to do that when we cover <a href="/notes-a10">Tibble Joins</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="separating-and-uniting" class="section level4">
<h4>Separating and Uniting</h4>
<p>The <code>tidyr</code> package has a function for gluing columns together (<code>unite</code>) and for cutting columns apart (<code>separate</code>.
Think back to our WHO Tuberculosis example from the very beginning again. This was one of our untidy representations:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>table3</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 × 3
##   country      year rate             
## * &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;            
## 1 Afghanistan  1999 745/19987071     
## 2 Afghanistan  2000 2666/20595360    
## 3 Brazil       1999 37737/172006362  
## 4 Brazil       2000 80488/174504898  
## 5 China        1999 212258/1272915272
## 6 China        2000 213766/1280428583</code></pre>
<p>The <code>rate</code> column contains the values of two variables: case counts and population counts. We would like to snip it apart at the “/” character to create two columns:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>(table5 &lt;- table3 %&gt;% separate(col = rate, 
                    into = c(&quot;cases&quot;, &quot;population&quot;)))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 × 4
##   country      year cases  population
##   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;     
## 1 Afghanistan  1999 745    19987071  
## 2 Afghanistan  2000 2666   20595360  
## 3 Brazil       1999 37737  172006362 
## 4 Brazil       2000 80488  174504898 
## 5 China        1999 212258 1272915272
## 6 China        2000 213766 1280428583</code></pre>
<p>The <code>col</code> argument specifies the column we want to separate,
and the <code>into</code> argument specifies the names of the new columns. The <code>sep</code> argument (not specified here) specifies where we want to cut. The default is pretty clever - it separates at any non-alphanumeric value. (How this is accomplished involves <em>regular expressions</em>, which are very useful when working with character data. We will learn more about regular expressions in STAT 545B. )</p>
<p>We need the inverse operation <code>unite</code> far less frequently. For completeness, we will “untidy” <code>table5</code> by transforming it back to <code>table3</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>table5 %&gt;% unite(col=new, 
                 cases, population, 
                 sep=&quot;/&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 × 3
##   country      year new              
##   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;            
## 1 Afghanistan  1999 745/19987071     
## 2 Afghanistan  2000 2666/20595360

## 5 China        1999 212258/1272915272
## 6 China        2000 213766/1280428583</code></pre>
<p>Useful note: we can also specify which columns we wanted to glue together using <code>tidyselect</code> helpers.</p>

<h2>Coda: Tidy data and data ethics</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Of course, it is very easy to disregard people you have never met, and who are certainly not your friends or family members. After all, in the eyes of an outsider, who is in no danger whatsoever, the people caught up in the situation are nothing more than simply statistics.” - Andrew James Pritchard, “Not Collateral Damage”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book <a href="https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/">“Data Feminism”</a> by Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein “presents a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics that is informed by the ideas of intersectional feminism”. Power is an important theme throughout the book: they point out that “data collection has long been employed as a technique of consolidating knowledge about the people whose data are collected, and therefore consolidating power over their lives.”</p>
<p>In Chapter 5, the authors make several points about cleaning and tidying data:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Data do not need cleaning until there are strangers in the dataset … Being a stranger in the dataset is not an inherently bad thing, but it carries significant risk of what renowned postcolonial scholar Gayatri Spivak calls <em>epistemic violence</em> - the harm that dominant groups like colonial powers wreak by privileging their ways of knowing over local and Indigenous ways.”</p></li>
<li><p>Tidying data is a “lossy” process: “But what might be lost in the process of dominating and disciplining data? Whose perspectives might be lost in that process? And, conversely, whose perspectives might be additionally imposed?”</p></li>
<li><p>Further riffing on that point: “the process of cleaning and tidying data … at times, can be a destructive rather than constructive act. One way to think of it is like chopping off the roots of a tree that connects it to the ground from which it grew. <strong>It’s an act that irreversibly separates the data from their context.</strong>”</p></li>
<li><p>Untidy data is not inherently “bad”, and tidy data is not inherently “good”: “The ideas expressed by Wickham, and by the press, carry the assumption that all data scientists, in all contexts, value cleanliness and control over messiness and complexity … these are not the requirements, nor the goals, of all data projects.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These are important points for us to reflect on as a data science community.</p>
