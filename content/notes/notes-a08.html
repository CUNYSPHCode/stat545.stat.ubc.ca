<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>From this topic, students are anticipated to be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>recognize whether a given dataset is ‘tidy’ or ‘untidy’</li>
<li>understand why ‘tidy’ data is useful</li>
<li>convert a dataset between the ‘long’ and ‘wide’ format, using <code>tidyr::pivot_longer()</code> and <code>tidyr::pivot_wider()</code></li>
<li>deal with missing data in a tibble</li>
</ul>
<p>We will spend 1-2 days on this topic.</p>

<h2>How to tidy your data</h2>
<div id="step-1-what-are-the-underlying-variables-and-observations" class="section level3">
<h3>Step 1: What are the underlying variables and observations?</h3>
<p>Step 1 is to figure out what the underlying variables and observations are. This might seem straightforward, but it can be surprisingly hard because it <strong>depends on the (statistical) question being asked</strong>.</p>
<div id="example-great-british-bakeoff" class="section level4">
<h4>Example: Great British Bakeoff</h4>
<p>We will demonstrate using data from “The Great British Bake Off” compiled by <a href="https://www.apreshill.com/">Allison Hill</a> in the R package <code>bakeoff</code>. (Note that this package is not hosted on CRAN, so if you would like to install it, you will need to run <code>install.packages("remotes")</code> then type <code>remotes::install_github("apreshill/bakeoff")</code> into R.) The code that follows was lightly adapted from Allison’s <a href="https://www.apreshill.com/talk/2019-rladies-sydney/">Plot Twist talk</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a bar plot of the number of viewers in millions within a 7-day window per episode, coloured by series.</p>
<p><img src="/notes/notes-a08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This bar plot was constructed with the following tidy data representation:</p>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 × 4
##   ep_id viewers_7day series episode
##   &lt;int&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1     1         2.24      1       1
## 2     2         3         1       2
## 3     3         3         1       3
## 4     4         2.6       1       4
## 5     5         3.03      1       5
## 6     6         2.75      1       6</code></pre>
<p>Every row is an observation (a unique episode), and the columns are variables (a continuous episode number across series, 7-day viewership, series, and episode number within series).</p>
<p>Here is another bar plot displaying percentage increase in the number of viewers in millions within a 7-day window from the premiere episode to finale episode for the first 10 series.</p>
<p><img src="/notes/notes-a08_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Notice that our observations and variables have changed! Our observations are now <em>series</em>, and our relevant <em>variables</em> are now the number of viewers in millions within a 7-day window for the first and last episode of each series. Given these variables, we could calculate the variable we display in the bar plot (the percentage increase in viewers from the premiere to finale) with the logic <code>(last-first)/first</code>. In other words, the tidy data representation is this wider format:</p>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 × 3
##   series first  last
##   &lt;fct&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 1       2.24  2.75
## 2 2       3.1   5.06
## 3 3       3.85  6.74
## 4 4       6.6   9.45
## 5 5       8.51 13.5 
## 6 6      11.6  15.0</code></pre>
<p>The moral of the story: what is “tidy” can differ for <strong>the exact same data set</strong>. This is because what is an observation and what is a variable depends on the statistical question being asked! Once again, we return to the words of the great philosopher Aretha Franklin …</p>

<p>“You better think (think) about what you’re trying to do …” - Aretha Franklin, “Think”</p>
</blockquote>

<div id="step-2-pivot" class="section level3">
<h3>Step 2: Pivot</h3>
<p>In Step 1, we decided what the underlying variables and observations are. In Step 2, we will produce the corresponding tidy representation by <strong>pivoting</strong> your data.</p>
<p>The <code>tidyr</code> package is loaded with the <code>tidyverse</code> and provides functions for pivoting data. It has two main functions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>pivot_longer()</code> makes datasets <em>longer</em> by increasing the number of rows and decreasing the number of columns.</li>
<li><code>pivot_wider()</code> makes datasets <em>wider</em> by decreasing the number of rows and increasing the number of columns.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that pivoting used to be achieved through the tidyr <code>spread()</code> and <code>gather()</code> functions. These are now deprecated and should not be used. They are only kept along with the tidyr package for backward compatibility.</p>

<h2>Coda: Tidy data and data ethics</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Of course, it is very easy to disregard people you have never met, and who are certainly not your friends or family members. After all, in the eyes of an outsider, who is in no danger whatsoever, the people caught up in the situation are nothing more than simply statistics.” - Andrew James Pritchard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book <a href="https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/">“Data Feminism”</a> by Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein “presents a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics that is informed by the ideas of intersectional feminism”. Power is an important theme throughout the book: they point out that “data collection has long been employed as a technique of consolidating knowledge about the people whose data are collected, and therefore consolidating power over their lives.”</p>
<p>In Chapter 5, the authors make several points about cleaning and tidying data:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Data do not need cleaning until there are strangers in the dataset … Being a stranger in the dataset is not an inherently bad thing, but it carries significant risk of what renowned postcolonial scholar Gayatri Spivak calls <em>epistemic violence</em> - the harm that dominant groups like colonial powers wreak by privileging their ways of knowing over local and Indigenous ways.”</p></li>
<li><p>Tidying data is a “lossy” process: “But what might be lost in the process of dominating and disciplining data? Whose perspectives might be lost in that process? And, conversely, whose perspectives might be additionally imposed?”</p></li>
<li><p>Further riffing on that point: “the process of cleaning and tidying data … at times, can be a destructive rather than constructive act. One way to think of it is like chopping off the roots of a tree that connects it to the ground from which it grew. <strong>It’s an act that irreversibly separates the data from their context.</strong>”</p></li>
<li><p>Untidy data is not inherently “bad”, and tidy data is not inherently “good”: “The ideas expressed by Wickham, and by the press, carry the assumption that all data scientists, in all contexts, value cleanliness and control over messiness and complexity … these are not the requirements, nor the goals, of all data projects.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These are important conversations for us as a data science community to have.</p>
