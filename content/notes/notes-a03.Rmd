## Test Your Understanding

1.  True or False: Since GitHub only displays the code behind an html file, we need to output to pdf if we want to be able to view the rendering on GitHub.
2.  True or False: It doesn't make sense to output an .Rmd file to markdown, because .Rmd is already markdown.
3.  Which of these file formats are proprietary? (a) `.docx`; (b) `.html`; (c) `.txt`; (d) `.Rmd`; (e) `.xlsx`

## Introduction to (R) Markdown and knitr

Using an editor like MS Word (or WYSIWYG editors) is like painting: you decorate the page with text, graphs, and tables, making sure things are positioned, sized, and coloured appropriately. Using (R) markdown lets you write a "blueprint" for your analysis, which includes "instructions" on how to format the text, and can be rendered to a prettier looking document.

### Getting started with markdown

1.  In RStudio, go to "File" -> "New File" -> "Markdown File".

2.  Explore various markdown features. In other words, "instructions" as to how to render the document. For example:

    -   Headers
    -   Bold, italics
    -   "Code format" using backticks.
    -   Lists

3.  Render the document to html. Render it to pdf. Ignore the "YAML header" that's automatically added to the top of your file, for now. Notice that an *output* file was generated from the *source* file.

    -   Never edit the output file. It will only be overwritten when you re-render the file.

4.  Open the `.md` file using a different editor.

    -   Notice that the file does not depend on a *program* to view it -- unlike MS Word, for example, where a word file can only be opened by MS Word.
    -   You may notice different colours showing up in the text, depending on which program we're using. This is called *syntax highlighting*, and it's a program's way of helping you write plain text without it all blurring together. But, ultimately, it's still just plain text that can't be bolded, increased in size, etc. -- such features do not come with plain text.

### Getting started with R Markdown

1.  Open a new .Rmd file in RStudio.

2.  To get started with using R Markdown, you'll need to install the **rmarkdown** R package. You might automatically be prompted to do this; accept, if so. If not, you will have to manually install the package. Also, the activity we have also depends on the **DT** package:

        install.packages('rmarkdown')
        install.packages('DT')

3.  Click "knit".

    -   Notice that R code is executed in *chunks*, and the output is displayed in the output file.

### Exploring the YAML header

*(**Got lost in the demonstration?** No problem, just open a new `.Rmd` file in RStudio via "File" -> "New File" -> "R Markdown...", and just press "OK", and resume!)*

1.  Go to the top of the .Rmd document, and explore the *YAML header*.

    -   The YAML header is contained between two `---`, and contains metadata on the document.

2.  Add some other data to the YAML header. Explore the options in [Yihui Xie's RMarkdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html). Some options to consider:

    -   Keep the "md" intermediate file with `keep_md: true`
    -   Add a theme. My favorite is cerulean: `theme: cerulean`
    -   Add a table of contents with `toc: true`
    -   Make the toc float: `toc_float: true`

3.  Knit the document to see how the file changes.

4.  Try knitting to different outputs. This is a tremendously useful feature of Rmd! (and plain text in general).

### Exploring code chunks

*(**Got lost in the demonstration?** No problem, just open a new `.Rmd` file in RStudio via "File" -> "New File" -> "R Markdown...", and just press "OK", and resume!)*

1.  Add a code chunk at the bottom of the `.Rmd` file. Either select "Insert" -> "R", or use a keyboard shortcut: `cmd + option + I` (MAC) / `ctrl + alt + i` (WINDOWS).

2.  Print out the `mtcars` data frame to explore the output. (Yes, this object comes shipped with R.)

3.  Try out the `DT::datatable()` function on `mtcars`, and knit the file (to html, ideally).

4.  Continue the markdown commentary! If you were to give this document to someone to read through your "analysis", a few notes would make it more readable.

5.  Add an [in-line code chunk](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-4.html) specifying the number of rows of the mtcars dataset. Hint: `nrow()`.

### Last touches! Exploring chunk options

*(**Got lost in the demonstration?** No problem, just open a new `.Rmd` file in RStudio via "File" -> "New File" -> "R Markdown...", and just press "OK", and resume!)*

Just like YAML is metadata for the Rmd document, *code chunk options* are metadata for the code chunk. Specify them within the `{r}` at the top of a code chunk, separated by commas. For a list of chunk options, check out [Yihui Xie's knitr book](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/). Let's try some:

1.  In any of the code chunks that you have created above, hide the code from the output with `echo = FALSE`. It would look like this `{r echo = FALSE}`.

2.  Change the figure width and height with `fig.width = 5` and `fig.height = 3`.

3.  Knit the results. Can you spot the differences?

## Work on Collaborative Project

Agenda:

1.  Getting setup with a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) (so that you can sync GitHub with files on your computer):

    -   Quick start:

        -   [Step 1:]{.ul} Create a PAT

            -   Option 1: Go to to <https://github.com/settings/tokens> and click "Generate token".

            -   Option 2: From R, execute `usethis::create_github_token()` (you may have to install the usethis package first by first running `install.packages("usethis")`).

            **BE SURE TO COPY YOUR TOKEN!**

        -   [Step 2:]{.ul} From R, execute `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()` and enter the PAT that you just made when prompted. That should be it!

        -   [Step 3 (recommended)]{.ul}: Also save the PAT that you just made somewhere secure, like a password manager.

    -   More detailed instructions and troubleshooting: [HappyGit](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html)

2.  Overview of collaborative project.

3.  Demonstrate making the group repository.

4.  Work period: contact your group and set up your repository. (\~10 minutes).

    1.  Find your group number, and contact your teammates through Slack (start a thread amongst the 3-4 of you, ideally). Please do not physically move around the classroom, but you may feel comfortable talking with those beside you, if you're present in-person.
    2.  Choose someone to make the team's repository, and to invite the others as collaborators to the repository.
    3.  If time remains, work on "Exercise 5: Teamwork Contract" with your teammates, or work by yourself on "Exercise 4: GitHub Issues".

5.  Create a branch (together)

    1.  Make sure your project is open in RStudio (you may have to clone it. Remember: "File" -> "New Project" -> "Version Control".)
    2.  Under the "Git" tab, click the "New Branch" button. Give the branch a name. When prompted, say yes to syncing the branch with GitHub (the "remote").

6.  Make changes, and merge the branch via a pull request. (My turn)

    1.  I'll make changes to the project files, commit them, and push them.
    2.  I'll explore the remote repository (i.e., GitHub), to show you the changes made on the branch.
    3.  I'll initialize a pull request (on GitHub), and will merge it.
