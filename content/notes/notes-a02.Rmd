```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = "asis"}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3, 
                      fig.align = "center", error = TRUE)
```

## Learning Objectives

From today's topic, students are anticipated to be able to:

-   use git on their own computer (locally).
-   connect between a local git repository and that repository on GitHub, using RStudio.
-   make commits in git using RStudio.
-   make a branch in git using RStudio or GitHub.
-   use collaborative GitHub features such as Issues and pull requests.

## Resources

Today's class is a digest of the following resources:

Video lectures:

-   [STAT 545 Episode 2-A: Git and GitHub for an Organized Project](https://youtu.be/l2ftm-YwJs8)

Tutorials:

-   The basic version control workflow (without branching): [Happy git w R: Chapter 20](https://happygitwithr.com/git-basics.html).

-   Syncing files on your computer with GitHub:

    -   Starting with GitHub: [Chapter 15: New project, GitHub first](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html)
    -   Starting with files on your computer, and didn't set up git: [Chapter 16: Existing project, GitHub first](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-first.html)
    -   Starting with files on your computer, and *did* set up git: [Chapter 17: Existing project, GitHub Last](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-last.html)

Some additional resources that you might find useful:

-   Read the [Understanding the GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) to get a sense of branching.

## Test Your Understanding

1.  You've just successfully pushed your branch to GitHub! True or False: it's still possible for the branch on GitHub to contain work that's not on your computer.
2.  You're ready to push some code you added to `code.R` to GitHub, but just found out that your teammate completely changed `code.R` on GitHub! True or False: If you pull the repository from GitHub, you'll get an error because your `code.R` conflicts with GitHub's `code.R`.
3.  True or False: If you've just changed a file on your computer, in order to push it to GitHub, you'll first need to commit the file.

## Demonstration

Here's what we'll aim to accomplish in class.

### Get Acquainted with GitHub

-   Orgs vs. personal account: explore these two.

-   Issues: check out course topics Issue in STAT 545 repo.

    -   Watching repo

-   Working on GitHub: Change the README on a GitHub repo

### Linear Synchronizing: Working between GitHub and Local; Merge Conflicts

-   clone stat 545 repo
-   make a local change -> commit, push, check GitHub.
-   make a GitHub change, then a local NON CONFLICTING change -> sync.
-   make a GitHub change, then a local CONFLICTING change -> sync.

### Branching and PR

Let's organize our participation repo in a branch.

-   Make a branch.

    -   GitHub first, local second
    -   Local first, GitHub second

-   Add a new file on the branch.

-   Switch branches to see file appear and disappear.

-   submit and merge a PR.
