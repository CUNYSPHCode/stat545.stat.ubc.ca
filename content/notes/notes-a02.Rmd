## Learning Objectives

From today's topic, students are anticipated to be able to:

- use git on their own computer (locally).
- connect between a local git repository and that repository on GitHub, using RStudio.
- make commits in git using RStudio.
- make a branch in git using RStudio or GitHub.
- use collaborative GitHub features such as Issues and pull requests.

## Parallel Resources

Today's class is a digest of the following resources:

- [STAT 545 Episode 2-A: Git and GitHub for an Organized Project](https://youtu.be/l2ftm-YwJs8) (a copy is also available on Canvas)
- Read about the basic version control workflow (without branching) at [Happy git w R: Chapter 20](https://happygitwithr.com/git-basics.html).
- Read the [Understanding the GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) to get a sense of branching.

We suggest referring to this material when engaging with today's topic.

Some additional resources that you might find useful:

- Linking a project between GitHub and local:
    - [From GitHub to local](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html)
    - [From local to GitHub](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-last.html)


## Quiz

1. You've just successfully pushed your branch to GitHub! True or False: it's still possible for the branch on GitHub to contain work that's not on your computer.
2. You're ready to push some code you added to `code.R` to GitHub, but just found out that your teammate completely changed `code.R` on GitHub! True or False: If you pull the repository from GitHub, you'll get an error because your `code.R` conflicts with GitHub's `code.R`. 
3. True or False: If you've just changed a file on your computer, in order to push it to GitHub, you'll first need to commit the file. 

## Demonstration

### Get Acquainted with GitHub

- Orgs vs. personal account: Explore some of my personal repos vs. some of my organization repos
- Issues: check out course topics Issue in STAT 545 repo.
  - Watching repo
- Working on GitHub: Change the README on STAT 545 site on GitHub

### Linear Synchronizing: Working between GitHub and Local; Merge Conflicts

- clone stat 545 repo
- make a local change -> commit, push, check GitHub.
- make a GitHub change, then a local NON CONFLICTING change -> sync.
- make a GitHub change, then a local CONFLICTING change -> sync.

### Branching and PR

Let's organize our participation repo in a branch.

- Make a branch.
  - GitHub first, local second
  - Local first, GitHub second
- Add a new file on the branch.
- Switch branches to see file appear and disappear.
- submit and merge a PR.
