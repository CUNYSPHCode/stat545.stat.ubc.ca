```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = "asis"}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3, 
                      fig.align = "center", error = TRUE)
```


## Learning Objectives

From today's class, students are anticipated to be able to:

+ Recognize the advantages of the tidyverse compared to base R with respect to good coding practice.
+ Subset and rearrange data with dplyr.
+ Use piping when implementing function chains.
+ Explore data in tibbles.

## Parallel Resources

This topic parallels the following resources. Take about 30 minutes to get acquainted with the following before coming to class:

- [STAT 545 Episode 4-A: dplyr Part 1: Basic Data Manipulation](https://youtu.be/Gms3zSPqCk8)
- Follow through [Jenny Bryan's Introduction to dplyr](https://stat545.com/dplyr-intro.html) at your own pace; this is optional, but very helpful in getting familiar with dplyr! You will have the chance to practice more in this week's worksheet.

We suggest referring to this material when engaging with today's topic.

## Additional Resources

- [R4DS Data Transformation](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html) 
- [R4DS Pipes](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html)
- [Intro to dplyr vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html)

## Quiz

1. True or False? Running filter or select on your tibble permanently changes your tibble. 
2. True or False? The pipe operator `%>%` works for functions outside of the tidyverse, too.

## Demonstration

We will go through Worksheet 2-A in class.
