## Learning Objectives

From today's class, students are anticipated to be able to:

  * How to run an R script non-interactively
  * How to use `make`
    - to record which files are inputs vs. intermediates vs. outputs
    - to capture how scripts and commands convert inputs to outputs
    - to re-run parts of an analysis that are out-of-date
  * The intersection of R and `make`, i.e. how to
    - run snippets of R code
    - run an entire R script
    - render an R Markdown document (or R script)
  * The interface between RStudio and `make`
  * How to use `make` from the shell
  * How Git facilitates the process of building a pipeline


## Prepare for Class

Read/watch one of the following two resources before class:

- Watch STAT 545 Episode
- 

## Resources

- Useful resources: https://www.r-bloggers.com/long-running-r-commands-unix-screen-nohup-and-r/ and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53486153/how-to-write-console-output-to-a-text-file-with-rscript-like-you-can-with-r-cmd


## Outline

- The case for non-interactive programming; philosophy behind a multi-file analysis. Notion of an "instance" of R. 
- How to run interactively vs. from source:
  - Rmd: run interactively by just executing the cells; from source = knit.
  - R script: interactive = just execute code (moves it to console); from source = "render report" or `source()`.
  - Then move on to bash
- Crash course on the command line (bash; zsh).
- running R scripts in the background. "jobs".
  - The idea behind cloud computing: run code non-interactively from a server. Need to make sure software is installed: docker. 
- `source()` for reading in a particular R script.
- makefiles for running parts of an analysis, or the whole thing. 
- Draw from my recent analysis
