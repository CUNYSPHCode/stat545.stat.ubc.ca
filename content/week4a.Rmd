<!-- ******TUESDAY'S CLASS****** -->

## Tuesday's Class `r tues_class_num`: Data Wrangling II

```{r tues-date}
cat(tues_date_pretty)
```

From today's class, students are anticipated to be able to:

+ Grouping data to compute summarized functions using `dplyr::group_by()` and `dplyr::summarize()`
+ Compute new columns using `mutate()`
+ Use `dplyr::across()` to use functions with specific columns

#### Prepare for Class

- Watch the [STAT 545 Video Series: Episode 6-A](https://youtu.be/38BA_v7BwKk)
- We recommend you read / skim through the following resources for more details: 
   - [Jenny's "dplyr single table verbs"](https://stat545.com/dplyr-single.html) for dplyr verbs.
   - [Hadley's "across" blog post](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/dplyr-1-0-0-colwise/) to learn more about `across()`

Some useful (but not mandatory) readings are:

- [Jenny's dplyr tutorial](https://stat545.com/dplyr-single.html)
- [dplyr vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html)

#### During Class

+ 9:30 - 9:50: In class demo, covering:
  + group_by
  + summarize
  + across
+ 9:50 - 10:00: Quiz.
+ 10:00 - 10:05: Break.
