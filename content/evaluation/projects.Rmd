This project is broken down into 6 milestones and there will be two major themes, the first is an analysis pipeline and the second is the creation of a dashboard using the same dataset.

## Group Assignments

Your teams of 2 have been randomly assigned, with no human intervention.
*The list will be posted on Canvas soon, once the class roster has stabilized a bit.*

## [Milestone 1: Dataset, EDA, and research question.](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/evaluation/milestone_01/milestone_01/)

In this milestone you will setup your group repository, choose a dataset appropriate for the STAT 547 team project, do some preliminary EDA, and come up with a research question.

## [Milestone 2: Write scripts].(https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/evaluation/milestone_02/milestone_02/)

In this milestone, you will address feedback from TAs about milestone1, continue and refine your analysis to clean and wrangle your data.
You will then convert all your interactive code into stand-alone scripts that take arguments.

## Milestone 3: Tests, linear regression, and automation

In this milestone, you will address feedback from TAs about milestone2, add a linear regression, implement tests in your functions, and automate the creation of the report.
This week you will clean up your report and submit a final report.

## Milestone 4: Sketch of your dashboard.

In this milestone, you will address feedback from TAs about milestone3, create a proposal of what your interactive dashboard will do, and how it will be used.

## Milestone 5: First draft of dashboard

In this milestone, you will address feedback from TAs about milestone4, create a draft of your dashboard and ensure its core components are functional.

## Milestone 6: Final version of deployed dashboard

In this milestone, you will address feedback from TAs about milestone4, refine your dashboard (by adding callbacks), and deploy the dashboard online.
