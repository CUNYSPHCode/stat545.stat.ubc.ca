## Schedule

Here are the deadlines for assignments, with links (to appear after assignments are released). 

All submissions are due by 23:59. I highly recommend aiming to finish before the last lecture so that we can help you if need be!

## Setup

All assignments will be submitted to a single repository created by GitHub Classroom. To create the repository, just follow [this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/PAa_IIPO), and follow the instructions. Your homework repository will be created for you in the [STAT545-UBC-hw-2019-20](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-hw-2019-20) Organization under the name `STAT545-hw-<your username>`.

FYI: This repository is public.

## The assignment life cycle

Here is the general flow that will happen for the assignments.

1. When an assignment is released, a GitHub Issue will be posted in the [Announcements](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-hw-2019-20/Announcements) repo, tagging the teaching team and students (you should get an email notification, too, unless you are not `Watch`ing the `Announcements` repo or are not on the class roster, or you disabled notifications).
2. Develop your homework responses on your homework repository.
3. Upon completion of your assignment, it would be useful for you to submit a link to your URL in the UBC [Canvas](https://canvas.ubc.ca) page. We will be putting your grades there.

## How the assignments are graded

The assignments make use of [UBC MDS's rubrics](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/tree/master/rubric). Within each assignment, we let you know which rubrics are being used and where, along with their weighting. Each rubric typically has six "levels" defined by letter grades, which map to the following percentages as [defined by UBC](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/Vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,42,96,0):

| Category | Grade Range |
|----------|-------------|
| No attempt (0)          | 0 |
| Poor (F)                | 0 - 49% |
| Unsatisfactory (D)      | 50% - 54% |
| Satisfactory (C- to C+) | 55% - 67% |
| Good (B- to B+)         | 68% - 79% |
| Excellent (A- to A+)    | 80% - 100% |

## Submission Instructions

1. Tag a release.
2. Submit link to GitHub

### Advice

**Commit your work often!**

**Commit your work often!**

**Commit your work often!**

Too many times, I see students wait until they finish their assignments to commit and push to GitHub. This is a very bad idea for at least two reasons:

1. If you submit your work late, we can grade your work as it was on the last commit before the deadline, which is probably better than taking a 50% (or even 0) penalty. 
2. Your workflow will not be as effective as it could be by using version control.

### Reflection

Once you're done the above, go back to [UBC canvas](https://canvas.ubc.ca/), and find the "Homework 01" page. Here, you should submit a reflection (and, although not required, adding a link to your homework respository would be helpful for the markers). 

Please don't skip this reflection! We really care about this.

Some things you can include:

- A description of how you got the changes into `README.md` on GitHub.
    - Did you edit in the browser at github.com?
    - Did you pull, edit locally, save, commit, push to github.com?
- How did it all work for the R Markdown document?
- You're encouraged to reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc.


### Special Submission Cases

**Are you worried about submitting early, and then wanting to make changes that are included in your submission?**

Don't be. We'll always grade your GitHub repository as it was at the last commit prior to the deadline. Therefore, we encourage you to submit early and often, especially regarding your GitHub repository!

**Want to submit early, and continue making contributions to your repository that you _don't_ want to be graded?**

Just [create a release](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) of your homework repo, and include the link to this release in your submission, being sure to indicate that this is a special early release that you want graded. Or, even better, just fork the repo.

## Tidy Submission

Each assignment will have some marks set aside for a "tidy" submission, as indicated on each assignment. A tidy submission is defined here. 

- Each assignment should be self-contained in a folder within your STAT 545A homework repository, found in [the hw Org](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-hw-2019-20).
	- Special case for Assignment 01, which also evaluates your repo's `README.md` file.
- Your work must be reproducible from beginning to end. That is, a member of the teaching team should be able to run all code error-free and reproduce the output files. 
- Your scripts do not contain code that installs packages (this is not good practice anyway) â€“ note that this is different from loading packages with the `library()` function, which is good!
- All R Markdown files are `knit`ted to an output readable on GitHub (probably `github_document` or `pdf_document`).
- You followed the assignment submission instructions.

If there's any further uncertainty in determining a grade for the tidy submission portion, the [UBC MDS mechanics rubric](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_mech.md) will be referred to.
