title: "STAT 545A Assignment 05: Factor and figure management"
---


__Due ~~Tuesday October 15~~ (Extended to) Thursday October 17th, 2019 at 23:59__

## Overview

Goals:

* Write some data to file and load it back into R.
* Explain the value of the here::here package
* Improve a figure (or make one from scratch), using new knowledge, e.g., control the color scheme, use factor levels, smoother mechanics.
* Reorder a factor in a principled way based on the data and demonstrate the effect in arranged data and in figures.
* Implement visualization design principles.

The goal of this homework is to get you thinking about data portability, collaboration, and dissemination of your work more widely. You will learn to import and export your datasets and also practice effective plotting principles.

Remember your homework should serve as your own personal cheatsheet in the future for canonical tasks. Make things nice -- your future self will thank you!

## Tidy Submission (10%)

### Mechanics (5%)

Follow the instructions for making a tidy submission, found on the [assignments home page](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/evaluation/assignments).

**NEW**: Like in Assignment 03 and 04, you are also expected to link to any html files that you produce, as a webpage. But, this time, this is only __if__ you produce an HTML file in your homework.

If there's any further uncertainty in determining a grade for this "mechanics" portion, the [UBC MDS mechanics rubric](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_mech.md) will be referred to.

### Writing (5%)

- You must use proper English, spelling, and grammar.
- You should write concisely. 
- If there's any further uncertainty in determining a grade here, the [UBC MDS writing rubric](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_writing.md) will be used.

### Data

You can work with the gapminder data, or adapt the tasks to suit some other data set, such as [Joey's singer dataset](https://github.com/JoeyBernhardt/singer).

## Exercise 1: Explain the value of the here::here package (10%)

__Rubric__:

- 5%: [Writing](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_writing.md) will be used.
- 5%: [Accuracy](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_accuracy.md)

Read through the [blog post by Malcolm Barrett](https://malco.io/2018/11/05/why-should-i-use-the-here-package-when-i-m-already-using-projects/) where he outlines why one should use the here::here package in RStudio projects.

Task: **In your own words**, summarize the value of the here::here package in 250 words or fewer. 

## Exercise 2: Factor management (20%)

__Rubric__:

- 10%: [Accuracy](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_accuracy.md)?
- 10%: [Code quality](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_quality.md)

Task: Choose **one** dataset (of your choice) and a variable to explore. After ensuring the variable(s) you're exploring are indeed factors, you should:

1. Drop factor / levels;
2. Reorder levels based on knowledge from data.

We've elaborated on these steps for the gapminder and singer data sets below.

Be sure to also characterize the (derived) data before and after your factor re-leveling:

* Explore the effects of `arrange()`. If you `arrange()` the data before plotting, does it have any effect on a figure?
* Explore the effects of reordering a factor and factor reordering coupled with `arrange()`. Especially, what effect does this have on a figure?

These explorations should involve the data, the factor levels, and some figures.

#### Elaboration for the gapminder data set

**Drop Oceania.** Filter the Gapminder data to remove observations associated with the `continent` of Oceania.  Additionally, remove unused factor levels. Provide concrete information on the data before and after removing these rows and Oceania; address the number of rows and the levels of the affected factors.

**Reorder the levels of `country` or `continent`.** Use the forcats package to change the order of the factor levels, based on a principled summary of one of the quantitative variables. Consider experimenting with a summary statistic beyond the most basic choice of the median.

#### Elaboration for the Singer data set

If necessary, transform some of the variables in the `singer_locations` dataframe into factors: pay attention at what levels you introduce and their order. Hint use the `forcats` package for this.

**Drop 0.** Filter the `singer_locations` data to remove observations associated with the uncorrectly inputed `year` 0.  Additionally, remove unused factor levels. Provide concrete information on the data before and after removing these rows and levels; address the number of rows and the levels of the affected factors.

**Reorder the levels of `year`, `artist_name` or `title`.** Use the forcats package to change the order of the factor levels, based on a principled summary of one of the quantitative variables. Consider experimenting with a summary statistic beyond the most basic choice of the median.

## Exercise 3: File input/output (I/O) (20%)

__Rubric__:

- 10%: [Accuracy](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_accuracy.md)?
- 10%: [Code quality](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_quality.md)

Task: Experiment with at least one of:

- `write_csv()/read_csv()` (and/or TSV friends), 
- `saveRDS()/readRDS()`, 
- `dput()/dget()`. 

You are expected to create something new, probably by filtering or grouped-summarization of your dataset (for e.g., Singer, Gapminder, or another dataset), export it to disk and then reload it back in using one of the packages above. 

Play around with factor levels and make your data non-alphabetical. For the I/O method(s) you chose, comment on whether or not your newly created file survived the round trip of writing to file then reading back in.

## Exercise 4: Visualization design (20%)

__Rubric__:

- 5%: [Writing](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_writing.md)
- 5%: [Accuracy](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_accuracy.md)
- 10%: [Vis quality](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_viz.md)

Go back through your previous assignments and class participation activities and find figures you created prior to the last week of the course. Recreate at least one figure in light of something you learned in the recent class meetings about visualization design and color. 

Task: Create a side-by-side plot and juxtapose your first attempt (show the original figure as-is) with a revised attempt after some time spent working on it and implementing principles of effective plotting principles. Comment and reflect on the differences.

## Exercise 5: Writing figures to file (10%)

- 5%: [Accuracy](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_accuracy.md)?
- 5%: [Code quality](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_quality.md)

Task: Use `ggsave()` to explicitly save a plot to file. Include the exported plot as part of your repository and assignment.

Then, use `![Alt text](/path/to/img.png)` to load and embed that file into your report. You can play around with various options, such as:

* Arguments of `ggsave()`, such as width, height, resolution or text scaling.
* Various graphics devices, e.g. a vector vs. raster format.
* Explicit provision of the plot object `p` via `ggsave(..., plot = p)`. Show a situation in which this actually matters.

## Finishing up and Reflection

This is your last STAT 545 assignment, but I encourage you not to stop working with R here! Continue exploring datasets - whether they are your datasets, or the thousands of [sample datasets](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html) on the internet. If you get stuck, there is a tremendous amount of resources out there including open online textbooks [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz), [Advanced R for Data Science](https://adv-r.hadley.nz), the [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/index.html) package, and of course, StackOverflow and Google.

Best of luck with your R journey, and hope to see you in STAT 547 in the spring!

## (Optional, ungraded) Exercise 6: But I want to do more!

If you're particularly keen on levelling up the challenge of this assignment, try these things (this is all optional, and will not be graded):

Make a deeper exploration of the forcats packages, i.e. try more of the factor level reordering functions.

Revalue a factor, e.g.:

* **Gapminder version**: Pick a handful of countries, each of which you can associate with a stereotypical food (or any other non-controversial thing ... sport? hobby? type of music, art or dance? animal? landscape feature?). Create an excerpt of the Gapminder data, filtered to just these countries. Create a new factor -- you pick the name! -- by mapping the existing country factor levels to the new levels.
    - Examples: Italy --> wine, Germany --> beer, Japan --> sake. (Austria, Germany) --> German, (Mexico, Spain) --> Spanish, (Portugal, Brazil) --> Portuguese. Let your creativity flourish.

* **Singer version**: Pick a handful of locations (they are named `city`, try using `distinct()`) that you can pinpoint to a geographical place (city, region, country, continent,...). Create an excerpt of the Singer data, filtered to just those rows. Create a (couple of) new factor(s) -- you pick the name(s)! -- by mapping the existing `city` factor levels to the new (city, region, country...) levels.
    - Examples: "London, England" --> "London", "England", "UK", "Europe";  
    - "Los Angeles, CA" --> "Los Angeles", "California", "USA", "Americas";
    - ...
    - "310, Louisiana" --> "New Orleans", "Louisiana", "USA", "Americas".  
    
You could even try to make this process of geolocalization more streamlined: you may want to try and use the `separate` function from tidyr.
