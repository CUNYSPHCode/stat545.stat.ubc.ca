title: "Participation Assessment"
date: "Updated 2019-09-18"

<p><strong>Due</strong>: Monday, October 21, at 23:59.</p>
<p>The intent of the participation assessment is to encourage following along with class activities, which are usually coding sessions. You’ll be putting all your in-class work in your own participation repository hosted on your GitHub user account, which we will evaluate at the end of the course.</p>
<div id="expectations" class="section level2">
<h2>Expectations</h2>
<p>In short, we’re evaluating <em>completeness</em>, not <em>correctness</em>. Specifically:</p>
<p>Your participation component will be evaluated by the completeness of your repository. You’ll be prompted in class when you should be contributing to your participation repository.</p>
<div id="completeness-70" class="section level3">
<h3>Completeness (70%)</h3>
<p>Your repository should be <em>complete</em> with all in-class exercises. Your work should resemble an honest <em>attempt</em> at the activities, but <strong>does not</strong> need to be anywhere near “correct” – even completely failing at an activity will earn you full marks here!</p>
<p>Each of the 14 classes wil receive equal weight here (5% per class).</p>
</div>
<div id="documentation-30" class="section level3">
<h3>Documentation (30%)</h3>
<p>Your repository should be <em>well-documented</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>10%: Does your main README orient a stranger to your repository?</li>
<li>10%: Will a stranger be able to figure out what the main files of your repository are for, and where they are located?</li>
<li>10%: Are the contents of your files human readable? Although we aren’t expecting publication-quality prose, there should be a moderate level of readability of your scripts to earn you full points here.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="missing-class" class="section level3">
<h3>Missing Class</h3>
<p>If you miss class, you can still do the activities another time.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="setup" class="section level2">
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>Here are the instructions to set up your participation repository.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>On your user account, make a new repository:
<ul>
<li>Click the “+” in the top-right corner -&gt; “New repository”</li>
<li>Call it <code>STAT545-participation</code></li>
<li>We highly recommend making this a <em>public</em> repo. But if you so desire, make it private. You can change this later.</li>
<li>Say YES to initializing with a README.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Add the teaching team as collaborators:
<ul>
<li>Click on “Settings” -&gt; “Collaborators”.</li>
<li>Add the instructors: <code>vincenzocoia</code> and <code>firasm</code></li>
<li>Add the TA’s (see note below)
<ul>
<li>Alejandra: <code>aleurcelay</code></li>
<li>Hossam: <code>hsmohammed</code></li>
<li>Victor: <code>wvictor14</code></li>
<li>Yulia: <code>yuliaUU</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Submit your participation repo to canvas right away, by submitting a URL to the repo.
<ul>
<li>Don’t worry, we won’t grade it until it’s finished.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If your participation repo is private, and you have a free GitHub account without the student developer pack, you will be limited to adding three collaborators. Add the instructors (<code>vincenzocoia</code> and <code>firasm</code>), along with the TA who will be grading your participation repo. Will be listed later.</p>
</div>
<div id="submitting-your-participation-repository" class="section level2">
<h2>Submitting your participation repository</h2>
<p>If you’ve completed Step 3 in the above “Setup” section, you don’t have to do anything. We will grade your repository as it was on the last commit before the deadline.</p>
</div>
