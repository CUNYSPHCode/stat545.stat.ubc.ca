title: "Participation Assessment"

<p><strong>MAY CHANGE FOR 2019/2020</strong></p>
<p>The intent of the participation assessment is to give students practice addressing many questions that each have narrow scope. This is as opposed to the homework, where you work on fewer questions with larger scope.</p>
<p>There are two goals:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Help students grasp smaller concepts as they are encountered in lecture.</li>
<li>Give students a foundation for approaching the assignments.</li>
</ol>
<div id="evaluation" class="section level2">
<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>Your participation component will be evaluated by:</p>
<ul>
<li><del>Participation in class discussions</del></li>
<li>Submitting work on in-class activities to your <del>STAT 545 home</del> participation GitHub repository (see below for setup).
<ul>
<li>Be sure to submit activities in class, not at some other time!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Activity in the Issues of the two <code>Discussion</code> repositories – with preference given to <a href="https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion"><code>Discussion</code></a> (public) over <a href="https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion-Internal"><code>Discussion-Internal</code></a> (private).</li>
</ul>
<p>For participation, we <strong>never</strong> evaluate <em>correctness</em>! Only whether or not the <em>attempt</em> was there.</p>
<p>Will you be missing any classes for some legitimate reason (such as academic, health, or other)? It’s okay! Just let me know ahead of time. We won’t be looking for a commit timestamp for that day, but we do expect you to show at least some engagement with the material (for example, trying exercises in the worksheet – as much as you feel is appropriate).</p>
</div>
<div id="your-participation-repository" class="section level2">
<h2>Your participation repository</h2>
<p>Now that STAT 545 uses GitHub Classroom, STAT 545 will no longer be using one repository to hold all the work of a student. To evaluate your participation through work on in-class activities, I think it’s most appropriate that we use a repository <em>that you create under your own account</em>.</p>
<div id="making-the-participation-repository" class="section level3">
<h3>Making the participation repository</h3>
<p><strong>If you’ve already created a repository in Class Meeting 02</strong> (probably called <code>STAT545_md_explorer</code>), rename and use that one:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Navigate to that repository’s home page.</li>
<li>Click “settings”.</li>
<li>At the top of the page, rename the repository <code>STAT545_participation</code>.</li>
<li>Make sure it’s public!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>If you did not make said repository</strong>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Go to github.com.</li>
<li>Make a new repository.
<ul>
<li>Call it <code>STAT545_participation</code>.</li>
<li>Make sure it’s public.</li>
<li>Yes, initiate the repository with a README.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="expectations-for-the-participation-repository" class="section level3">
<h3>Expectations for the participation repository</h3>
<ul>
<li>You’ll need to make your repository <em>navigable</em>.
<ul>
<li>Make sure that whoever is grading your STAT 545 participation is able to find your attempts at the in-class exercises. This involves keeping a clean folder structure, and making the README informative (what’s in the repo? how can a visitor find things?)</li>
<li>It probably makes most sense to make a folder for each class meeting, perhaps named <code>cm002</code>, <code>cm003</code>, etc… more on folders in GitHub in cm004.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Push/upload all work done in-class to this repository</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="submitting-your-participation-repository" class="section level3">
<h3>Submitting your participation repository</h3>
<p><em><strong>You do not have to wait until the end of the course to do this</strong></em>! You are encouraged to do this as soon as you can.</p>
<p>To gain participation marks, you’ll need to submit a link to your <code>STAT545_participation</code> repository on canvas.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Go to <a href="https://canvas.ubc.ca">UBC Canvas</a>.</li>
<li>Find the “Participation” assignment.</li>
<li>Submit a link to your participation repository.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div id="stat-547m" class="section level2">
<h2>STAT 547M</h2>
<p>You can use your STAT 545 participation repo for STAT 547M.</p>
