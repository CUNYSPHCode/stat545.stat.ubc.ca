In this milestone, you will address feedback from TAs about milestone1, continue and refine your analysis to clean and wrangle your data. 
You will then convert all your interactive code into stand-alone scripts that take in  arguments using `docopt`.

## Expectations
- You should be committing to git every time you work on this project.
- git commit messages should be meaningful. These will be marked. It's OK if one or two are less meaningful, but most should be.
- After the repository is set-up, each group member should fork the repository to their personal GitHub.com account and work there, and send pull-requests of their work to the upstream repo (the one they forked). The other team mate should review, critique (if necessary) and finally accept their team mates pull request.
  - See below for "how to catch up to a forked repo if there are changes upstream".
- Use GitHub issues to communicate to their team mate (as opposed to email or Slack)
- Your question, analysis and visualization should make sense. It doesn't have to be complicated.
- You should use proper grammar and full sentences in your README. Point form may occur, but should be less than 10% of your written documents.
- You **must** include the URL of your report in the `README.md` file of your project repo so we can easily view it.
- Create a release on your project repo named milestone1 and submit that URL on Canvas for us to grade.
  - Here is an example of the URL we are expecting for milestone1: [https://github.com/STAT547-UBC-2019-20/demo_project/tree/milestone1](https://github.com/STAT547-UBC-2019-20/demo_project/tree/milestone1)

## Mechanics (15%)

Follow the instructions for making a tidy submission, found on the [assignments home page](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/evaluation/assignments).

If there's any further uncertainty in determining a grade for this "mechanics" portion, the [UBC MDS mechanics rubric](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_mech.md) will be referred to.

## Writing (10%)

- You must use proper English, spelling, and grammar.
- You should write concisely. 
- If there's any further uncertainty in determining a grade here, the [UBC MDS writing rubric](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_writing.md) will be used.

## Task 1. Organize your repository (5%)

To prepare your repository for automation next week, you should spend some time cleaning up and organizing your repository. 

Here is a suggested directory structure (you may choose alternates if it makes more sense for your project and analysis):

- `docs`: Move your Rmd files here, include your final report.
- `data`: Your raw data will be downloaded here. Also, if you re-save your data after cleaning/wrangling, it shold be saved as a new file here.
- `scripts` (or `src`): move all your scripts here. This directory should only contain scripts
- `images`: your scripts should export images to this directory, also include any images needed for your report
- `tests`: You will add some tests to your functions next week, this directory can be empty for this week

## **Task 2. Convert your interactive notebook to (at least) 4 scripts** (60%)

This task is the bulk of the work for milestone2.

### **Task 2.1: Write a script to load in your data.**

Your script should:

- Live in the `scripts` directory
- Have at least ONE command-line argument (at minimum, you may have more as well)
- Take in the raw data URL as a command-line argument
- Run without any intervention from the user after running the script:
  - `Rscript src/script_name.r --data_url=<url_to_raw_data_file>`
- Download and save the data in the `data` directory
- Print a helpful message to the terminal informing the user that the script completed successfully

### **Task 2.2: Write a script to wrangle/clean/process your data.**

Your script should:

- Live in the `scripts` directory
- Have at least TWO command-line arguments (at minimum, you may have more as well)
- Take in a path to the raw data path as a command-line argument
- Take in the filename to where the wrangled data should be saved as a command-line argument
- Wrangle/clean/process your raw data and save a new version of data for later analysis
- Run without any intervention from the user after running the script
- Print a helpful message to the terminal informing the user that the script completed successfully

### **Task 2.3: Write an EDA script for your data**

Your script should:

- Live in the `scripts` directory
- Perform the analysis you did in week 1 and save the plots as separate png files 
- Take in a path where exported images should be saved (likely `images`) as a command-line argument
- Run without any intervention from the user after running the script
- Print a helpful message to the terminal informing the user that the script completed successfully

### **Task 2.4: Write a script to knit your DRAFT of your final report (an Rmarkdown file) to an HTML and PDF file **

Your draft final report should:

- Be done in Rmarkdown and should not have any "hard-coded" numbers and values
- Have an introduction/motivation and description of research question
- Have a section describing your dataset (EDA); make sure you import pngs from the `images` directory rather than creating them again!
- Have a section for your methods (placeholder for a linear regression to be done next week)
- Have a section for your results (placeholder for a linear regression to be done next week)
- Have a section for your discussion/conclusion (placeholder for a linear regression to be done next week)
- Be a new, different document than the EDA document you submitted for `milestone1` (though you can liberally borrow from your report, particularly the introduction)

Your script should:

- Live in the `scripts` directory
- Knit your Rmarkdown file to an HTML *and* a PDF file exported to the root of the repository (not in a folder)
- 
- Run without any intervention from the user after running the script
- Print a helpful message to the terminal informing the user that the script completed successfully

## **Task 3: Script Usage ** (10%)

Your final task for this milestone is to add a **USAGE** section in your project README.
This section should have instructions on how someone should completely reproduce your analysis from start to finish.
You should list all packages and dependencies required for your project.
What level of reproducibility should you expect?
Well, imagine if someone clones your repository, deletes all the files in every directory except your README, the `scripts` and `docs` directory - could they follow your instructions in the USAGE section to reproduce your final report?

```

1. Clone this repo.

2. Ensure the following packages are installed:

  - ggplot2
  - dplyr
  - cowplot
  - etc...

3. Run the following scripts (in order) with the appropriate arguments specified

  # Download data
  Rscript src/script_name.r --data_url=<url_to_raw_data_file>
  
  # Wrangle/clean/process your data 
  Rscript src/script_name.r --argument_name=<argument> ... (etc)
  
  # EDA script to export images
  Rscript src/script_name.r --argument_name=<argument> ... (etc)
  
  # Knit your draft final report
  Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('... (etc)
```

## Example of final product

One of your TAs (Matthew) has prepared an example of what we are expecting for this milestone.
We will release this to you after Thursday's lecture and you will be able to find it [here](https://github.com/STAT547-UBC-2019-20/demo_project/tree/milestone2).
