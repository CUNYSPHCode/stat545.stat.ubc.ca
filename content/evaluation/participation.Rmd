title: "Participation Assessment"
date: "Updated `r Sys.Date()`"

__Due__: Monday, October 21, at 23:59.

The intent of the participation assessment is to encourage following along with class activities, which are usually coding sessions. You'll be putting all your in-class work in your own participation repository hosted on your GitHub user account, which we will evaluate at the end of the course.

## Expectations

In short, we're evaluating _completeness_, not _correctness_. Specifically:

Your participation component will be evaluated by the completeness of your repository. You'll be prompted in class when you should be contributing to your participation repository. 

### Completeness (70%)

Your repository should be _complete_ with all in-class exercises. Your work should resemble an honest _attempt_ at the activities, but __does not__ need to be anywhere near "correct" -- even completely failing at an activity will earn you full marks here!

Each of the 14 classes wil receive equal weight here (5% per class).

### Documentation (30%)

Your repository should be _well-documented_. 

- 10%: Does your main README orient a stranger to your repository?
- 10%: Will a stranger be able to figure out what the main files of your repository are for, and where they are located?
- 10%: Are the contents of your files human readable? Although we aren't expecting publication-quality prose, there should be a moderate level of readability of your scripts to earn you full points here.

### Missing Class

If you miss class, you can still do the activities another time. 


## Setup

Here are the instructions to set up your participation repository.

1. On your user account, make a new repository:
    - Click the "+" in the top-right corner -> "New repository"
    - Call it `STAT545-participation`
    - We highly recommend making this a _public_ repo. But if you so desire, make it private. You can change this later.
    - Say YES to initializing with a README. 
2. Add the teaching team as collaborators:
	- Click on "Settings" -> "Collaborators".
	- Add the instructors: `vincenzocoia` and `firasm`
	- Add the TA who is grading your repo:
		- Alejandra: `aleurcelay`
		- Hossam:    `hsmohammed`
		- Victor:    `wvictor14`
		- Yulia:     `yuliaUU`
3. Submit your participation repo to canvas right away, by submitting a URL to the repo.
    - Don't worry, we won't grade it until it's finished. 

## Submitting your participation repository

If you've completed Step 3 in the above "Setup" section, you don't have to do anything. We will grade your repository as it was on the last commit before the deadline.
