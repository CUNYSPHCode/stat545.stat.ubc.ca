```{r setup, include=FALSE}
## This script determines the peer review -- who reviews whom? -- and puts 
##  this in a nice (?) table that hopefully contains obvious instructions 
##  for the students. This is saved as a csv in the `STAT545-UBC` repo, 
##  assuming you have that located in the same folder as this `InstructorsOnly` repo.
##  This table is `kable`d in the actual hw assignments automatically. This part of 
##  the automation is set up that way, making sure that the hw has an Rmd source 
##  instead of an md source.
