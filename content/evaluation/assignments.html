<h2>Schedule</h2>
<p>Here are the deadlines for assignments, with links (to appear after assignments are released).</p>
<p>A GitHub Issue will be posted in the <a href="https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-hw-2019-20/Announcements">Announcements</a> repo whenever a new assignment is released. The students will be tagged too, so you should get an email notification with it as well.</p>
<p>All submissions are due by 23:59. I highly recommend aiming to finish before the last lecture so that we can help you if need be!</p>

<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>The assignments make use of <a href="https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/tree/master/rubric">UBC MDS’s rubrics</a>. Within each assignment, we let you know which rubrics are being used and where, along with their weighting. Each rubric typically has six “levels” defined by letter grades, which map to the following percentages as <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/Vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,42,96,0">defined by UBC</a>:</p>

<div id="setting-up-your-homework-repository" class="section level2">
<h2>Setting up your homework repository</h2>
<p>Your assignments will be developed and submitted to a single repository created by GitHub Classroom (note that this is different from your participation repository). To create the repository, just follow <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/PAa_IIPO">this link</a>, and follow the instructions. Your homework repository will be created for you in the <a href="https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-hw-2019-20">STAT545-UBC-hw-2019-20</a> Organization under the name <code>STAT545-hw-&lt;your username&gt;</code>. You only have to do this once.</p>
<p>FYI: This repository is public.</p>
</div>
<div id="working-on-your-homework" class="section level2">
<h2>Working on your homework</h2>
<p>As you work on your assignment, you should commit and push your progress to GitHub. As a word of advice:</p>
<p><strong>Commit your work often!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commit your work often!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commit your work often!</strong></p>
<p>Too many times, I see students wait until they finish their assignments to commit and push to GitHub. This is a very bad idea for at least two reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If you submit your work late, we are forced to give you the late penalty. But if you’ve been committing your work, we can at least look at your repo as it was after the latest commit before the deadline.</li>
<li>Your workflow will not be as effective as it could be by using version control.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="tidy-submission" class="section level2">
<h2>Tidy Submission</h2>
<p>Each assignment will have some marks set aside for a “tidy” submission, which is defined here. If there’s any further uncertainty in determining a grade for the tidy submission portion, the <a href="https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_mech.md">UBC MDS mechanics rubric</a> will be referred to.</p>
<p>Before submitting your work, make sure it’s tidy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each assignment should be self-contained in a folder within your STAT 545A homework repository, found in <a href="https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-hw-2019-20">the hw Org</a>.
<ul>
<li>Special case for Assignment 01, which also evaluates your repo’s <code>README.md</code> file.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Your work must be reproducible from beginning to end. That is, a member of the teaching team should be able to run all code error-free and reproduce the output files.</li>
<li>Your scripts do not contain code that installs packages (this is not good practice anyway) – note that this is different from loading packages with the <code>library()</code> function, which is good!</li>
<li>All R Markdown files are <code>knit</code>ted to an output readable on GitHub (probably <code>github_document</code> or <code>pdf_document</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is how you submit your homework:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If you’re working locally (i.e., on your hard drive), push your work to your GitHub homework repository.</li>
<li>On your GitHub homework repository, <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/">tag a release</a>.
<ul>
<li>As a “tag version”, we recommend putting <code>hw1.0</code> for assignment 1, <code>hw2.0</code> for assignment 2, etc.</li>
<li>If you want to make changes to your release before the deadline, just tag a new release like <code>hw1.1</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Go to the course page on <a href="https://canvas.ubc.ca">UBC canvas</a>, and find the corresponding assignment submission. Submit a URL to the latest release of your assignment.
<ul>
<li>You can find this by clicking on the “release” button on your GitHub homework repository, on (for example) the <code>hw1.0</code> text.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
