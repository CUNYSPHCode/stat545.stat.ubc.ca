<h2>The Assignment Life Cycle</h2>
<p>Here is the general flow that will happen for the assignments.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>When an assignment is released, I will post a GitHub Issue in the <a href="https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-hw-2019-20/Announcements">Announcements</a> repo, tagging the teaching team and students (you should get an email notification, too, unless you’ve (1) somehow disabled this, (2) are not <code>Watch</code>ing the <code>Announcements</code> repo, or (3) did not inform me of your GitHub username).</li>
<li>Develop your homework responses on your homework repository (see below)</li>
<li>Upon completion of your assignment, it would be useful for you to submit a link to your URL in the UBC Canvas page. We will be putting your grades there.</li>
</ol>

<h2>How your assignments are graded</h2>
<p><strong>MAY CHANGE FOR 2019/2020</strong></p>
<p>Components of each assignment will be graded on a 3-point scale. Here is the general rubric (<em>also consult any specific guidance given in the relevant assignment itself</em>).</p>

<tr class="odd">
<td>Coding style</td>
<td>Student has gone beyond what was expected and required, coding manual is followed, code is well commented</td>
<td>Coding style lacks refinement and has some errors, but code is readable and has some comments</td>
<td>Many errors in coding style, little attention paid to making the code human readable</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Coding strategy</td>
<td>Complicated problem broken down into sub-problems that are individually much simpler. Code is efficient, correct, and minimal. Code uses appropriate data structure (list, data frame, vector/matrix/array). Code checks for common errors</td>
<td>Code is correct, but could be edited down to leaner code. Some “hacking” instead of using suitable data structure. Some checks for errors.</td>
<td>Code tackles complicated problem in one big chunk. Code is repetitive and could easily be functionalized. No anticipation of errors.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Presentation: graphs</td>
<td>Graph(s) carefully tuned for desired purpose. One graph illustrates one point</td>
<td>Graph(s) well chosen, but with a few minor problems: inappropriate aspect ratios, poor labels.</td>
<td>Graph(s) poorly chosen to support questions.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Presentation: tables</td>
<td>Table(s) carefully constructed to make it easy to perform important comparisons. Careful styling highlights important features.</td>
<td>Table(s) generally appropriate but possibly some minor formatting deficiencies.</td>
<td>Table(s) with too many, or inconsistent, decimal places. Table(s) not appropriate for questions and findings. Major display problems.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Achievement, mastery, cleverness, creativity</td>
<td>Student has gone beyond what was expected and required, e.g., extraordinary effort, additional tools not addressed by this course, unusually sophisticated application of tools from course.</td>
<td>Tools and techniques from the course are applied very competently and, perhaps,somewhat creatively. Chosen task was acceptable, but fairly conservative in ambition.</td>
<td>Student does not display the expected level of mastery of the tools and techniques in this course. Chosen task was too limited in scope.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Ease of access for instructor, compliance with course conventions for submitted work</td>
<td>Access as easy as possible, code runs!</td>
<td>Satisfactory</td>
<td>Not an earnest effort to reduce friction and comply with conventions and/or code does not run</td>
