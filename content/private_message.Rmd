Here's a little guidance as to whom you should contact and how.

## How to contact a member of the teaching team

You can either:

- Send a private message over [Slack](https://stat545ubc.slack.com) **(recommended)**
- Send an email (check out the [teaching team](#teaching_team) section)

## Who to contact

### Have an issue with the way you were evaluated on a project?

Your TA will have left an Issue on your project GitHub repository. It's best to continue the conversation there to retain context. 

If you really prefer not, contact the TA directly that graded your work.

### Have an issue with the way you were evaluated, even after discussion with the TA?

If you've been having a discussion using a GitHub Issue, loop Vincenzo in by tagging him: `@vincenzocoia`.

Otherwise, contact Vincenzo directly.
