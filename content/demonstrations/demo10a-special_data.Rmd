### Factors

- "Canada" and "Other" with `fct_other()`
- Re-ordering of levels in plots:

  - Categories with counts are ordered
  - Categories with distributions are ordered by something of your choosing.
- Bar plot of the total number of penguins surveyed from each species -- noting that 5 species are missing.
