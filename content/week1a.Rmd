<!-- ******TUESDAY'S CLASS****** -->

## Tuesday's Class `r tues_class_num`: Class Cancelled

```{r tues-date}
cat(tues_date_pretty)
```

**Imagine Day: class cancelled**

Use today and tomorrow to prepare for the course:

+ Watch the [Intro to STAT 545 Video Series video](https://youtu.be/6REhJVsbbAM) (a version is also available on canvas for those who cannot access YouTube).
+ Install the software needed for STAT 545A by following along the tutorial ["Software Installation for STAT 545"](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/tutorials/software-stack/). **link fixed**

Note: each class will require some preparation. Take a look at the "Prepare for Class" section for Thursday's class!
