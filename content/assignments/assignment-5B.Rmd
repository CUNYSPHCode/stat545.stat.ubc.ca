## Overview

In Assignment 5-B, you will pick one of three options described below:

+ **Option A:** Strings Regex
+ **Option B:** Improve assignment 2b's R package. Or create a new one. The standards for this assignment will be higher than assignment 2b.
+ **Option C:** Improve assignment 3b's Shiny app. Or create a new one. The standards for this will be higher than assignment 3b.

Read all the instructions in this document *thoroughly* before proceeding with your assignment. The grading rubric is detailed at the very end, and *it doubles as a checklist* to keep track of your progress!

## Option A -- Strings in R

## Option B -- Improve your R package

For this option, you will be updating your package to a new version. For full marks, you will need to improve your R package *significantly*. What kind of improvements qualify as a *significant* improvement? This is of course a bit subjective and also dependent on your individual R packages, but the quality and quantity of changes should fall under the category of a **minor** or **major** release defined on [this page](https://r-pkgs.org/release.html#release-version). 

_**Note:** You might consider breaking up your changes into several minor releases or patches. This might make sense if you are both fixing a number of errors or bugs, and also adding significant functionality._

Before you start! Make sure that you indicate which version and tagged release corresponds to Assignment 2b. For many of you this is `v0.1.0`. If there was a problem with versioning, or you originally had forgotten to do this, just tag a release now before you start, and clearly indicate this in the README or in canvas.

#### Implement version updates (15 marks)

1. Create a list of _**at least 3 improvements or fixes**_ that you plan to address in this updated version. Put each distinct change (or set of changes) as a _**new github issue**_. Some examples of possible types of issues:
  - errors or bugs that needs to be fixed
  - added functionality
  - improved documentation

  **Any feedback that was given on your assignment 2b needs to be addressed!** If addressing TA feedback, please quote the feedback in the issue. Some of this feedback might not be substantial enough to warrant an entire github issue. For example, small typos do not need an entire github issue. See Rubric for more details on what qualifies as a "substantial" improvement.

2. Create these new changes in a _**new branch**_, titled something informative and unique (e.g. "updates" is not an informative title, "add-function-XYZ" is better).

3. _**Address each issue**_, while also ensuring that your R package still "works". It should "check" without errors. 

4. _**Create a pull request**_, comment and describe how each issue was addressed. Make sure you reference the issues with the appropriate hashtag, and also reference new files or lines of code when appropriate. 

5. _**Merge pull request and update version number**_. Also ensure that all documentation (including version number in `DESCRIPTION`) is updated. Don't forget to update `NEWS.md`

**Rubric**

- [ ] (4 points) Are the issues well-described?
  - Is it clear what the errors are and where they appear?
  - Is it clear what kind of challenges that new functionality addresses?
  - Do they take advantage of github's feature of referencing files and lines of code? 

- [ ] (4 points) Do the issues make sense?
  - Are the errors or bugs actually errors or bugs
  - Are issues distinct from each other? Does it make sense to group some set of changes together into a single github issue?
  - Are the issues substantial? 
    - e.g. a small typo in documentation does not warrant an entire github issue
    - e.g. missing description of the type of input (e.g. type of vector) is substantial enough
    - e.g. functions do not work on some types of inputs that should work is a good issue

- [ ] (1 pt) Do the branch(es) and pull request have a good title?
- [ ] (2 points) Does the pull request ddescribe how each issue was addressed?
  - The PR should summarize the changes that were made
  - Issues are referenced

- [ ] (4 points) The quality of the changess will be evaluated
  - Do the changes address the github issue
  - Are the changes minimal? 
    - Do they require unnecessary dependencies to be added? 
    - Is the code efficient?
  - Is documentation updated to reflect these changes?

#### README (5 marks)

Create a quality README. In Assignment 2b, we asked for a basic README with some brief description. Here, we want to see a README that:

- [ ] (1 pt) Describes the purpose of your R package
  - For example, describe the challenges or problems that your R package "solves"
  
- [ ] (3 pt) Has examples demonstrating the use of the core functions or datasets
  - Every major function in your package should be demonstrated
  - The examples should be easily ran by your users
  
- [ ] (1 pt) Writing is clear (link rubric)

#### Package design (BONUS, 1 mark)

Design:

A bonus mark will be awarded if,

- [ ] The package is designed in a user-friendly way (documentation and usability)
  - The documentation is clear and complete
  - The functionality is easy to use and makes sense
  
- [ ] The package is useful. It is clear that someone outside of STAT545 might benefit from a package like yours, potentially over other available options.

#### Submission

- [ ] Tag a release in your assignment repository. Update README describing that you picked this option for assignment 5b, and also provide a link to your updated package.

- [ ] In canvas, provide the tagged release to your assignment repository.

## Option C -- Improve your Shiny app

For this option, you will implement additional features and improvements to your shiny app that you worked on in Assignment 3b. 

#### Logistics 

Ensure that your assignment 3b shiny app is deployed and viewable on [shinyapps.io](). We will use this as a reference to mark your improved version.

In your assignment repository, start by copying over your app (code and any data files) to an Assignment 5b folder. Complete this assignment by editing this version of your app. When finished deploy this on [shinyapps.io]().

Update the README clearly indicating with links, which version is Assignment 5b, and which is Assignment 3b.

As usual, when you are ready to submit your work, tag a release and post this link to canvas.

#### Tasks

1. Implement any feedback given from Assignment 3b. 

2. Implement _**5 improvements or fixes**_  that you plan to address in this updated version. Describe these in the Assignment 5b README. These cannot be changes for the sake of change - they need to be obvious improvements to the app. Some options:
  - Make UI more user-friendly
    - Is there a better widget for choosing your input?
    - Are text, input, and ouput organized in a way that makes sense?
    - Consider experimenting with different preset layouts and [tabs](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/tabsets.html)
  - If you haven't already, implement a [theme](https://rstudio.github.io/shinythemes/)
  - Improve your server code. Make it more efficient. 
  - Address any errors, bugs, or unexpected outputs
  - Add functionality
    - can be in the form of widgets
    - more options in the UI, e.g. filtering options, plot/table customization
    - @Vincenzo, @Diana feel free to add here

**One of the five changes must be _added functionality_.** The other four are up to you!

3. The Assignment 5b README is a README for your app. Make sure that it is good quality. This means:
  - The README should describe the purpose of the app
  - The writing is clear (link rubric)

4. Make sure it is easy for someone to understand how to use your app, without needing to consult your README, or with help from you. In other words, if someone is given a link to your app, can they understand what your app does, and also how to use it? 

#### Rubric

- [ ] (2 points) Did you implement feedback from assignment 3b?

- [ ] (15 points) Five improvements (3 points/improvement) are described in README and implemented well. Each improvement will be graded as follows:
  - [ ] Are these good improvements?
    - This is about your decision to include these changes.
    - Are they consistent with the app's purpose? 
    - Does your new app feel like an improved version of the existing one, or does it now feel like an entirely different app?
    - They must be substantial improvements. Not small things like fixing typos
    - Do they fix broken things? Was there actually a need for this fix or improvement?
  - [ ] Do the implemented changes achieve your goals? 
    - e.g. do bug fixes actually fix the bugs, without introducing new errors
    - e.g. is new functionality in line with the app's purpose
    - e.g. does improved UI improve user-friendliness
    - e.g. does improved UI help better understand how users are supposed to engage with the app

- [ ] (1 points) The README is clear and describes the purpose of the app

- [ ] (1 points) The overall design of the app is good. 
  - The UI is user-friendly
  - It is clear what the app's purpose is
  - It's clear how the user needs to interact with the app
  - The server code is efficient
  
- [ ] (1 points) One point will be reserved for tidy'ness, file organization, and whether the submission instructions were followed correctly
