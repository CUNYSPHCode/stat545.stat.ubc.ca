## Overview

In Assignment 5-B, you will pick one of three options described below. Please indicate which one you choose in your Assignment 5b README.

+ **Option A:** Strings Regex
+ **Option B:** R Package 
+ **Option C:** Shiny App

Read all the instructions in this document *thoroughly* before proceeding with your assignment. The grading rubric is detailed at the very end, and *it doubles as a checklist* to keep track of your progress!

## Option A -- Strings in R

- Choose a stringr function and apply it to a dataset to get it into another form. We suggest the wedding dataset. In a brief sentence, say what it is that you did. 

Ideas from R4DS:

> - Explain why each of these strings don't match a \: "\", "\\", "\\\".
> - Is "q" always followed by a "u"?
> - Describe, in words, what these expressions will match:
>     - `(.)\1\1`
>     - `"(.)(.)\\2\\1"`
>     - `(..)\1`
>     - `"(.).\\1.\\1"`
>     - `"(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1"`

## Option B -- R package

For this option, you will be updating your package to a new version, or creating an entirely new R package from scratch. This time, we will be evaluating the *quality and overall design* of your R package, not just that you can create one. That means, not only do you need all of the components of a working R package, the quality of the components themselves will be expected to be of high quality. We will also evaluate the overall cohesiveness and design of the package.

Whereas the previous assignment focused on component additions evaluated by functionality (such as components of an R package being present and functional, or having added 3 functional features), this time we will evaluate how well your product forms a complete whole, satisfying a clearly stated purpose with an effectively designed interface ("interface" being how a user interacts with the product).

Feel free to start a new R package if you're not interested in building on assignment 2b. However, keep in mind that most of the requirements for assignment 2b are also required here, and more. 

If you have decided to improve assignment 2b, then be sure to have a properly tagged release and version number for assignment 2b, so that we can easily see the new changes you've implemented for assignment 5b. If there was a problem with versioning, or you originally had forgotten to do this, just tag a release now before you start, and clearly indicate this in the README or in canvas.

#### How to implement package updates

1. Create changes to your R package that you plan to address in this updated version. If appropriate, describe the improvements using **Github Issues**. Also consider taking advantage of Git Branches to categorize your changes.

  **Any feedback that was given on your assignment 2b needs to be addressed!** If addressing TA feedback, please quote the feedback in the issue. Some of this feedback might not be substantial enough to warrant an entire github issue. For example, small typos do not need an entire github issue. See the rubric below for more details on what qualifies as a "substantial" improvement.

2. _**Address each issue**_, while also ensuring that your R package still "works". It should "check" without errors. 

3. _**Create a pull request (or multiple, if appropriate)**_, comment and describe how each issue was addressed. Make sure you reference the issues with the appropriate hashtag, and also reference new files or lines of code when appropriate. 

5. _**Merge pull request(s) and update to an appropriate version number**_. Also ensure that all documentation (including version number in `DESCRIPTION`) is updated. Don't forget to update `NEWS.md`. See [here](https://r-pkgs.org/release.html#release-version) for help on deciding version numbering.

#### Option B - Rubric

**Basic structure and functionality (5 points)**

Following assignment 2b instructions and rubric may be helpful for completing this

- [ ] Do you have all essential components for your R package? 
  - [ ] All functions have tests
  - [ ] All functions and data have documentation
  - [ ] If data was included, did you include how the data was sourced?
  - [ ] DESCRIPTION has correct information
  - [ ] If your package is a data package, do you have a vignette?

**Code Mastery (5 points)**

- [ ] (3 points) Is your code written efficiently?
  - [ ] Did you use tidyverse when appropriate?
  - [ ] Is your code easy to understand? Did you write code comments when appropriate?
- [ ] (2 points) Are your tests good quality?

**Package design (7.5 points)**

- [ ] (2.5 points) Does your package have a clear and consistent purpose?
  - [ ] Functions and data make sense to be packaged together
  - e.g. `ggplot2` is a package all about plotting
  
- [ ] (2.5 points) Do package functions and data have user-friendly design?
  - Function arguments make sense
  - Data is organized appropriately and can be easily accessed
  - Documentation is helpful and complete
  
- [ ] (2.5) README and vignette is helpful
  - Purpose of package is clearly described
  - Functions and datasets are demonstrated
  - Examples should be easy to be run by users
  - *If developing a data package*, more weight will be put towards a providing a good quality vignette that showcases the data
  
- [Writing is clear](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_writing.md).

**Package development (2.5 points)**

- [ ] Did you develop your R package in a robust way, using `usethis` and `devtools`?
- [ ] Did you use Github Issues, branches, and pull requests in an appropriate manner? 
- [ ] Did you address all errors from running `check()`?
- [ ] Did you tag releases and update version numbers appropriately?

#### Submission

- [ ] Tag a release in your assignment repository. Update README describing that you picked this option for assignment 5b, and also provide a link to your updated package.

- [ ] In canvas, provide the tagged release to your assignment repository.

## Option C -- Improve your Shiny app

For this option, you will implement additional features and improvements to your shiny app that you worked on in Assignment 3b. 

#### Logistics 

Ensure that your assignment 3b shiny app is deployed and viewable on [shinyapps.io](). We will use this as a reference to mark your improved version.

In your assignment repository, start by copying over your app (code and any data files) to an Assignment 5b folder. Complete this assignment by editing this version of your app. When finished deploy this on [shinyapps.io]().

Update the README clearly indicating with links, which version is Assignment 5b, and which is Assignment 3b.

As usual, when you are ready to submit your work, tag a release and post this link to canvas.

#### Implement changes to your Shiny app

1. Implement **feedback given from Assignment 3b.** In your assignment 5b README, quote the feedback and also describe how you addressed the feedback. 

2. Implement **5 improvements or fixes**  that you plan to address in this updated version. *Clearly number these 5 changes and describe them in the Assignment 5b README*. These cannot be changes for the sake of change - they need to be **obvious improvements** to the app. For each change, make an argument on why your change is an improvement. 

Some example options:

  - Make UI more user-friendly
    - Is there a better widget for choosing your input?
    - Are text, input, and output organized in a way that makes sense?
    - Consider experimenting with different preset layouts and [tabs](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/tabsets.html)
  - If you haven't already, implement a [theme](https://rstudio.github.io/shinythemes/)
  - Improve your server code. Make it more efficient. 
  - Address any errors, bugs, or unexpected outputs
  - Add functionality
    - can be in the form of widgets
    - more options for the user, e.g. filtering options, plot/table customization
    - more output, or more specific output
    - @Vincenzo, @Diana feel free to add here

**One of the five changes must be _added functionality_.** The other four are up to you!

3. The assignment 5b README is a README for your app. Make sure that it is good quality. This means:
  - The README should describe the purpose of the app
  - It should briefly describe how the app works (user-interaction and expected output)
  - You use proper English, spelling, and grammar, and write concisely. If thereâ€™s any uncertainty in determining a grade here, the [UBC MDS writing rubric](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_writing.md) will be referred to. 

4. **Make sure it is easy for someone to understand how to use your app,** without needing to consult your README, or with help from you. In other words, if someone is given a link to your app, can they understand what your app does, and also how to use it? 

#### Option C - Rubric

**Implementing changes (16 points)**

- [ ] (1 points) Did you **implement feedback** from assignment 3b?

- [ ] (15 points) **Five improvements (3 points/improvement)** are described in README and implemented well. Each improvement will be graded as follows:
  - [ ] Are these good improvements?
    - Are they consistent with the app's purpose? 
    - Are they substantial? Or are they small things like fixing typos
    - Do they fix broken things? 
    - Is it clear that there is a need for this fix or improvement?
  - [ ] Do the implemented changes achieve your goals? 
    - e.g. do bug fixes actually fix the bugs, without introducing new errors
    - e.g. is new functionality in line with the app's purpose
    - e.g. does improved UI improve user-friendliness
    - e.g. does improved UI help better understand how users are supposed to engage with the app
  
  - Does your new app feel like an improved version of the existing one, or does it now feel like an entirely different app?

**README, code quality, and tidy'ness (4 points)**

- [ ] (1 points) The **README** is clear and describes the purpose of the app

- [ ] (1 points) Code is efficient and good quality
  - Is there unnecessary code?
  - Did you use `tidyverse` functions when appropriate?
  - Are there unnecessary dependencies?
  - Is the code easy to read?
  - If the code is not easy to read, did you narrate using code comments?
  - Were reactive expressions used appropriately?
  
- [ ] (1 points) One point will be reserved for *tidy'ness*, *file organization*, and whether the submission *instructions were followed* correctly

**Package design (BONUS, 1 mark)**

A bonus point will be awarded to exceptionally well-designed apps. At minimum the app should have these qualities:

- It's clear how the user needs to interact with the app
- The output makes sense and is easy to understand
- The UI is user-friendly
- The app is useful
- The server code is efficient and easy to understand
