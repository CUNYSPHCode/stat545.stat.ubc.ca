__Deadline__: Saturday, November 21, 2020

- Make a shiny dashboard of a data analysis. Maybe an aspect of their 545A analysis if they have one; maybe something from the purrr part of Assignment 1. Or maybe it doesn't need to relate to a previous analysis.
- Will probably be pretty close to [hw08 2018](https://github.com/UBC-STAT/stat545.stat.ubc.ca/blob/master/content/evaluation/hw08/hw08.md)
