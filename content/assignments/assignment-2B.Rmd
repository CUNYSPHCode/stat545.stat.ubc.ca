In Assignment 1-B, you practiced writing a function. This time, we'll be evaluating your ability to wrap an object, such as that function (but not necessarily), in an R package.

This assignment covers building an R package (covered in Week 3).

- [ ] For your convenience, we've indicated all action items with a checkbox, like so.

## Setup

While you used your assignment repository for `assignment-1b`, just putting your work in the `assignment-1b` directory, you may choose not to use this repository for this assignment.

For this assignment, you will be developing an R package, ideally open source. Because of this, it is ideal for you to have a _separate_ repository for this assignment. You will be creating a _new, separate_ repository under your own personal GitHub. Here is a [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo) on how to create your very own repository. Using your own personal GitHub will give you more control over the future of this assignment, should you want to develop your R package any further. It will also allow others to install your package more easily using the `devtools::install_github()` command. If you are creating a data package, and concerned about having your data available to the public, please reach out to the teaching team.

- [ ] Create a _new_, _public_ repository under your own personal GitHub account, naming it after your R package, OR
- [ ] Fork an existing repository

For more information on these two tasks, see details on Exercise 1.

## Tidy Submission (2 points)

Follow these steps to submit your work. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the rubric for a tidy submission below, before doing these steps.

- [ ] Update your main `README` for your _assignment_ repository with a link to your new R package repository. Your new repository _should not_ be named `assignment-2b`. In fact, it should be named whatever you decide to name your package!
- [ ] Make a `README` for your new package repository, using `usethis` to kickstart the `README`, and `devtools` to render it. Your `README` should describe what the package is, how to install it, and include an example usage of the package. The `datateachr` [repository](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/datateachr/blob/master/README.md) is a good example for a R dataset package. The `distplyr` [repository](https://github.com/vincenzocoia/distplyr/blob/master/README.md) is a good example for an R function(s) package.
- [ ] Tag a release in your GitHub repository _corresponding to the version release of your package_. Use [semantic versioning conventions](https://semver.org). While you will be submitting this release link to Canvas, do _NOT_ treat this release like a task for your assignment. This _is_ a release for your package.
  - Semantic versioning conventions: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, where initial development starts at `0.1.0`, and then increment the minor version for each subsequent release
    - Only release `1.0.0` if your package is being used in production and ready for public use
    - e.g. `0.1.0` :arrow_right: `0.1.1` :arrow_right: ... :arrow_right: `1.0.0` :arrow_right: `1.0.1` :arrow_right: ... :arrow_right: `1.1.0`

**Rubric**:

- The above steps were followed.
- Your work is self-contained in your new R package repository
- Your work must be reproducible from beginning to end. That is, a member of the teaching team should be able to run all code error-free and reproduce the output files.
- You use proper English, spelling, and grammar, and write concisely. If there's any uncertainty in determining a grade here, the [UBC MDS writing rubric](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_writing.md) will be referred to.
- If there's any further uncertainty in determining a grade for this tidy submission portion, the [UBC MDS mechanics rubric](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_mech.md) will be referred to.

## Exercise 1: Create an R Package (3 points)

- [ ] Create an R package that wraps _at least 1_ object. You _can_ wrap more than one object if you wish. To start, use the `create_package()` and `use_git()` functions to create your R package GitHub repository (if you haven't made or forked one yet). Make sure that your repository is _public_ so that we can mark it.

Suggested R packages:

- Turn your function(s) from `assignment-1b` into an R package
- Make a data package, like `palmerpenguins` or `gapminder`
  - This task is recommended if there is a dataset you are passionate or invested in
- Add to the [`vincenzo/powers`](https://github.com/vincenzocoia/powers) or [`jennybc/foofactors`](https://github.com/jennybc/foofactors) packages
  - The easiest way to do this task is to fork the repository you choose
    - Here are some [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) on forking a repo
    - "A fork is a copy of a repository that allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project." [_Source_](https://github.community/t/the-difference-between-forking-and-cloning-a-repository/10189)

## Exercise 1.1: Explain Your Development (2 points)

- [ ] Briefly explain how you made each part of your R package. This doesn't need to be very detailed, but rather at a high-level
  - [ ] Show the exact code you used from `usethis` or `devtools` to implement the package component
  - [ ] Describe any manual work you did with your files

## Exercise 1.2: Tests (3 points)

- [ ] Create tests for your package, in the appropriate files and folders, using `usethis` and `testthat`. You can use the tests you wrote in Assignment 1-B, if relevant.
  - [ ] Make sure your tests are also well-documented, meaning that the description/test name is informative, and that any necessary code commenting is present

## Exercise 1.3: Documentation of your R package (10 points)

- [ ] Create documentation for your R package.

Specifically:

- [ ] Use `roxygen2` comment style `#'` and tags like `@param` to document your function(s) or dataset(s)
  - [ ] Use `devtools::document()` to update documentation, so that the `?your_object` command is able to fetch your documentation
  - [ ] Make sure that all objects are `@export`ed unless there is a valid reason for them to be internal
      - [ ] Remember to justify your decisions
- [ ] Document _all_ functions and datasets
- [ ] List all package dependencies in their `DESCRIPTION` file using `usethis`
- [ ] `DESCRIPTION` file is otherwise up-to-date and informative
- [ ] If applicable, modify the source code of your function so that functions from other packages are called appropriately (e.g. using `::`)
- [ ] Add a license, using `usethis`
  - [ ] Explain why you chose that particular license
- [ ] Make a _short_ vignette for your package

**Optional**:

- [ ] Add a code of conduct, using `usethis::use_code_of_conduct()`
- [ ] Make a package website, and activate it with GitHub Pages. 
  - [ ] use the `pkgdown` package, using `usethis::use_pkgdown()`, and then `pkgdown::build_site()`
- [ ] Add to the Changelog or add a News article for the 'release' of your package
- [ ] Add "badges" to your `README`

**Rubric**: 

1. Are all the components of an R package present and high quality, complete with documentation and tests?
1. Is your R package made using a modern and robust way, using `usethis` and `devtools` packages? You should explain your development process in Exercise 1.2.
1. Your package passes the `check()` without errors (warnings and notes are OK).
