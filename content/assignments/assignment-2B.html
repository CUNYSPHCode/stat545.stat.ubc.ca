<p><strong>Deadline</strong>: Saturday, November 14, 2020</p>
<ul>
<li>Write your own R package. Maybe one of:
<ul>
<li>A data package.
<ul>
<li>Students can take data that’s relevant to their analysis and make a package out of it. Ideally, make it open-source so the world can use it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Turn their function(s) from Assignment 1-B into an R package.</li>
<li>Add to the <code>vincenzocoia/powers</code> or <code>jennybc/foofactors</code> packages – but in a fork not to be merged (since these are for expository purposes only).</li>
<li>Contribute to an open-source R package. Add a function, documentation, and a test. Maybe propose an update to a vignette.
<ul>
<li>Actually submit a pull request to improve the package if they choose. If this is the intent, should ask the developers beforehand to see if this is of interest.</li>
<li>Ideas: a new <code>geom</code> to ggplot; add <code>broom</code> tidy functions to a currently incompatible model.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Write about the steps you took to make the package. Important so that we know how you used the <code>usethis</code> and <code>devtools</code> packages.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Drawing inspiration from <a href="https://github.com/UBC-STAT/stat545.stat.ubc.ca/blob/master/content/evaluation/hw07/hw07.md">hw07 in 2018</a></li>
</ul>
