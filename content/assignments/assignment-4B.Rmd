- Automate a multi-script analysis. Ideally, one they've been working with.
- Demonstrate ability to run R in the background. Maybe even in the Makefile. 
- Probably close to [2018 hw09](https://github.com/UBC-STAT/stat545.stat.ubc.ca/blob/master/content/evaluation/hw09/hw09.md) except for the "run in the background" part.
