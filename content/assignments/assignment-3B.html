<p><strong>Deadline</strong>: Saturday, November 21, 2020</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a shiny dashboard of a data analysis. Maybe an aspect of their 545A analysis if they have one; maybe something from the purrr part of Assignment 1. Or maybe it doesnâ€™t need to relate to a previous analysis.</li>
<li>Will probably be pretty close to <a href="https://github.com/UBC-STAT/stat545.stat.ubc.ca/blob/master/content/evaluation/hw08/hw08.md">hw08 2018</a></li>
</ul>
