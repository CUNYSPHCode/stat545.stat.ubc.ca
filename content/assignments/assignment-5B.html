<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In Assignment 5-B, you will pick one of three options described below. Please indicate which one you choose in your Assignment 5b README.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Option A:</strong> Strings Regex</li>
<li><strong>Option B:</strong> R Package</li>
<li><strong>Option C:</strong> Shiny App</li>
</ul>
<p>Read all the instructions in this document <em>thoroughly</em> before proceeding with your assignment. The grading rubric is detailed at the very end, and <em>it doubles as a checklist</em> to keep track of your progress!</p>
</div>
<div id="option-a-strings-in-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Option A – Strings in R</h2>
<ul>
<li>Choose a stringr function and apply it to a dataset to get it into another form. We suggest the wedding dataset. In a brief sentence, say what it is that you did.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideas from R4DS:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explain why each of these strings don’t match a : “",”\“,”\".</li>
<li>Is “q” always followed by a “u”?</li>
<li>Describe, in words, what these expressions will match:
<ul>
<li><code>(.)\1\1</code></li>
<li><code>"(.)(.)\\2\\1"</code></li>
<li><code>(..)\1</code></li>
<li><code>"(.).\\1.\\1"</code></li>
<li><code>"(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1"</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="option-b-r-package" class="section level2">
<h2>Option B – R package</h2>
<p>For this option, you will be updating your package to a new version, or creating an entirely new R package from scratch. This time, we will be evaluating the <em>quality and overall design</em> of your R package, not just that you can create one. That means, not only do you need all of the components of a working R package, the quality of the components themselves will be expected to be of high quality. We will also evaluate the overall cohesiveness and design of the package.</p>
<p>Whereas the previous assignment focused on component additions evaluated by functionality (such as components of an R package being present and functional, or having added 3 functional features), this time we will evaluate how well your product forms a complete whole, satisfying a clearly stated purpose with an effectively designed interface (“interface” being how a user interacts with the product).</p>
<p>Feel free to start a new R package if you’re not interested in building on assignment 2b. However, keep in mind that most of the requirements for assignment 2b are also required here, and more.</p>
<p>If you have decided to improve assignment 2b, then be sure to have a properly tagged release and version number for assignment 2b, so that we can easily see the new changes you’ve implemented for assignment 5b. If there was a problem with versioning, or you originally had forgotten to do this, just tag a release now before you start, and clearly indicate this in the README or in canvas.</p>
<div id="how-to-implement-package-updates" class="section level4">
<h4>How to implement package updates</h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create changes to your R package that you plan to address in this updated version. If appropriate, describe the improvements using <strong>Github Issues</strong>. Also consider taking advantage of Git Branches to categorize your changes.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Any feedback that was given on your assignment 2b needs to be addressed!</strong> If addressing TA feedback, please quote the feedback in the issue. Some of this feedback might not be substantial enough to warrant an entire github issue. For example, small typos do not need an entire github issue. See the rubric below for more details on what qualifies as a “substantial” improvement.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><em><strong>Address each issue</strong></em>, while also ensuring that your R package still “works”. It should “check” without errors.</p></li>
<li><p><em><strong>Create a pull request (or multiple, if appropriate)</strong></em>, comment and describe how each issue was addressed. Make sure you reference the issues with the appropriate hashtag, and also reference new files or lines of code when appropriate.</p></li>
<li><p><em><strong>Merge pull request(s) and update to an appropriate version number</strong></em>. Also ensure that all documentation (including version number in <code>DESCRIPTION</code>) is updated. Don’t forget to update <code>NEWS.md</code>. See <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/release.html#release-version">here</a> for help on deciding version numbering.</p></li>

<div id="logistics" class="section level4">
<h4>Logistics</h4>
<p>Ensure that your assignment 3b shiny app is deployed and viewable on <a href="">shinyapps.io</a>. We will use this as a reference to mark your improved version.</p>
<p>In your assignment repository, start by copying over your app (code and any data files) to an Assignment 5b folder. Complete this assignment by editing this version of your app. When finished deploy this on <a href="">shinyapps.io</a>.</p>
<p>Update the README clearly indicating with links, which version is Assignment 5b, and which is Assignment 3b.</p>
<p>As usual, when you are ready to submit your work, tag a release and post this link to canvas.</p>

</ol>
<p>Some example options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make UI more user-friendly
<ul>
<li>Is there a better widget for choosing your input?</li>

<ul>
<li>The README should describe the purpose of the app</li>
<li>It should briefly describe how the app works (user-interaction and expected output)</li>
<li>You use proper English, spelling, and grammar, and write concisely. If there’s any uncertainty in determining a grade here, the <a href="https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_writing.md">UBC MDS writing rubric</a> will be referred to.</li>
