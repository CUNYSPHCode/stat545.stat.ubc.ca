<ul>
<li>regex assignment has never been all that inspiring in past years. <a href="https://github.com/UBC-STAT/stat545.stat.ubc.ca/blob/master/content/evaluation/hw06/hw06.md">hw06 from 2018</a> just asks students to do exercises in R4DS book.</li>
<li>maybe this year, since we moved regex to the last week, we can make this part of the choose-your-adventure theme so that students don’t have to necessarily do regex outside of the worksheet if they don’t want. Ideas listed in Lecture Notes 6-B.
<ul>
<li>Another idea: add onto something they did in a past assignment – continue with their R package, or shiny dashboard, …</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
