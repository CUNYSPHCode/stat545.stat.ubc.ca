<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In Assignment 5-B, you will pick one of three options described below. Please indicate which one you choose in your Assignment 5b README.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Option A:</strong> Strings Regex</li>
<li><strong>Option B:</strong> Improve assignment 2b’s R package. Or create a new one. The standards for this assignment will be higher than assignment 2b.</li>
<li><strong>Option C:</strong> Improve assignment 3b’s Shiny app. Or create a new one. The standards for this will be higher than assignment 3b.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read all the instructions in this document <em>thoroughly</em> before proceeding with your assignment. The grading rubric is detailed at the very end, and <em>it doubles as a checklist</em> to keep track of your progress!</p>
</div>
<div id="option-a-strings-in-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Option A – Strings in R</h2>
</div>
<div id="option-b-improve-your-r-package" class="section level2">
<h2>Option B – Improve your R package</h2>
<p>For this option, you will be updating your package to a new version. For full marks, you will need to improve your R package <em>significantly</em>. This time, we will be evaluating the quality of your R package, not just that you can create one. What kind of improvements qualify as a <em>significant</em> improvement? This is of course a bit subjective and also dependent on your individual R packages, but the quality and quantity of changes should fall under the category of a <strong>minor</strong> or <strong>major</strong> release defined on <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/release.html#release-version">this page</a>. Update your version number accordingly.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> You might consider breaking up your changes into several minor releases or patches. This might make sense if you are both fixing a number of distinct errors or bugs, and also adding significant functionality.</em></p>
<p>Before you start! Make sure that you indicate which version and tagged release corresponds to Assignment 2b. For many of you this is <code>v0.1.0</code>. If there was a problem with versioning, or you originally had forgotten to do this, just tag a release now before you start, and clearly indicate this in the README or in canvas.</p>
<div id="how-to-implement-package-updates" class="section level4">
<h4>How to implement package updates</h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Create a list of <em><strong>at least 3 improvements or fixes</strong></em> that you plan to address in this updated version. Put each distinct change (or set of changes) as a <em><strong>new github issue</strong></em>, and also briefly describe how you propose to address each issue. Some examples of possible types of issues:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>errors or bugs that needs to be fixed</li>
<li>added functionality</li>
<li>improved documentation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Any feedback that was given on your assignment 2b needs to be addressed!</strong> If addressing TA feedback, please quote the feedback in the issue. Some of this feedback might not be substantial enough to warrant an entire github issue. For example, small typos do not need an entire github issue. See the rubric below for more details on what qualifies as a “substantial” improvement.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Create these new changes in a <em><strong>new branch</strong></em>, titled something informative and unique (e.g. “updates” is not an informative title, “add-function-XYZ” is better).</p></li>
<li><p><em><strong>Address each issue</strong></em>, while also ensuring that your R package still “works”. It should “check” without errors.</p></li>
<li><p><em><strong>Create a pull request</strong></em>, comment and describe how each issue was addressed. Make sure you reference the issues with the appropriate hashtag, and also reference new files or lines of code when appropriate.</p></li>
<li><p><em><strong>Merge pull request and update version number</strong></em>. Also ensure that all documentation (including version number in <code>DESCRIPTION</code>) is updated. Don’t forget to update <code>NEWS.md</code></p></li>
</ol>

<div id="option-c-improve-your-shiny-app" class="section level2">
<h2>Option C – Improve your Shiny app</h2>
<p>For this option, you will implement additional features and improvements to your shiny app that you worked on in Assignment 3b.</p>
<div id="logistics" class="section level4">
<h4>Logistics</h4>
<p>Ensure that your assignment 3b shiny app is deployed and viewable on <a href="">shinyapps.io</a>. We will use this as a reference to mark your improved version.</p>
<p>In your assignment repository, start by copying over your app (code and any data files) to an Assignment 5b folder. Complete this assignment by editing this version of your app. When finished deploy this on <a href="">shinyapps.io</a>.</p>
<p>Update the README clearly indicating with links, which version is Assignment 5b, and which is Assignment 3b.</p>
<p>As usual, when you are ready to submit your work, tag a release and post this link to canvas.</p>
</div>
<div id="implement-changes-to-your-shiny-app" class="section level4">
<h4>Implement changes to your Shiny app</h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Implement <strong>feedback given from Assignment 3b.</strong> In your assignment 5b README, quote the feedback and also describe how you addressed the feedback.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement <strong>5 improvements or fixes</strong> that you plan to address in this updated version. <em>Clearly number these 5 changes and describe them in the Assignment 5b README</em>. These cannot be changes for the sake of change - they need to be <strong>obvious improvements</strong> to the app. For each change, make an argument on why your change is an improvement.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Some example options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make UI more user-friendly
<ul>
<li>Is there a better widget for choosing your input?</li>
<li>Are text, input, and output organized in a way that makes sense?</li>
<li>Consider experimenting with different preset layouts and <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/tabsets.html">tabs</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you haven’t already, implement a <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/shinythemes/">theme</a></li>
<li>Improve your server code. Make it more efficient.</li>
<li>Address any errors, bugs, or unexpected outputs</li>
<li>Add functionality
<ul>
<li>can be in the form of widgets</li>
<li>more options for the user, e.g. filtering options, plot/table customization</li>
<li>more output, or more specific output</li>
<li><span class="citation">@Vincenzo</span>, <span class="citation">@Diana</span> feel free to add here</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>One of the five changes must be <em>added functionality</em>.</strong> The other four are up to you!</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The assignment 5b README is a README for your app. Make sure that it is good quality. This means:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The README should describe the purpose of the app</li>
<li>It should briefly describe how the app works (user-interaction and expected output)</li>
<li>You use proper English, spelling, and grammar, and write concisely. If there’s any uncertainty in determining a grade here, the <a href="https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_writing.md">UBC MDS writing rubric</a> will be referred to.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Make sure it is easy for someone to understand how to use your app,</strong> without needing to consult your README, or with help from you. In other words, if someone is given a link to your app, can they understand what your app does, and also how to use it?</li>
