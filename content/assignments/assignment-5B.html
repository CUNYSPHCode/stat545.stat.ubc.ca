<p><strong>Deadline</strong>: Saturday, December 5, 2020</p>
<ul>
<li>regex assignment has never been all that inspiring in past years. <a href="https://github.com/UBC-STAT/stat545.stat.ubc.ca/blob/master/content/evaluation/hw06/hw06.md">hw06 from 2018</a> just asks students to do exercises in R4DS book.</li>
<li>maybe this year, since we moved regex to the last week, we can make this part of the choose-your-adventure theme so that students don’t have to necessarily do regex outside of the worksheet if they don’t want. Ideas listed in Lecture Notes 6-B.</li>
<li>Ideas for choose-your-own-adventure:
<ul>
<li>add onto something they did in a past assignment – continue with their R package (perhaps implementing S3 OO), or shiny dashboard, …</li>
<li>Contribute to an open-source R package. Add a function, documentation, and a test. Maybe propose an update to a vignette.
<ul>
<li>Actually submit a pull request to improve the package if they choose. If this is the intent, should ask the developers beforehand to see if this is of interest.</li>
<li>Ideas: a new <code>geom</code> to ggplot; add <code>broom</code> tidy functions to a currently incompatible model.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
