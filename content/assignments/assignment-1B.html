<p><strong>Total Points</strong>: 20</p>
<p>This assignment first covers making a function (Exercise 1, covered in Week 1), then using list columns (Exercise 2, covered in Week 2) to explore a data set.</p>
<ul>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
For your convenience, we’ve indicated all action items with a checkbox, like so.</li>
</ul>
<div id="setup" class="section level2">
<h2>Setup</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Go to canvas to get your invitation to the STAT 545 homework GitHub Organization. You can find this in the description of Assignment 1-B.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Work within your <code>assignment-1b</code> folder in your new repository, and complete the assignment by filling in this very .Rmd file. Your repo will be seeded with instructions for this milestone. Commit and push your work early and often (although this will not be graded, many students end up in situations where they wish they pushed more frequently).</li>
</ol>

<div id="tidy-submission-2-points" class="section level2">
<h2>Tidy Submission (2 points)</h2>
<p>Follow these steps to submit your work. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the rubric for a tidy submission below, before doing these steps.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Make a README file in your <code>assignment-1b</code> folder. It should let a visitor know what’s in this folder.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Make/update a main README file for your entire repository. It should orient a visitor to what this repository <em>is</em>, and that visitor should know how to engage with the repository. There should not be much here.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Make your assignment appear nicely rendered and viewable online, such as by changing the output to <code>output: github_document</code> in the YAML header.<ul>
<li>You could also use GitHub pages. But, the assignment needs to correspond to the tagged release, and we still need to be able to navigate to your repository somehow.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Tag a release in your GitHub repository corresponding to your submission before the deadline.<ul>
<li>Forgotten how to tag a release? We have instructions at the bottom of the <a href="https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/collaborative-project/milestone1/readme/">Collaborative Milestone 1 repo</a> from STAT 545A.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Grab the URL corresponding to your viewable output from Step 3, and submit that to canvas. Also, please let us know what you thought of this assignment – any feedback would be appreciated.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Rubric</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The above steps were followed.</li>
<li>Your work is self-contained in the <code>assignment-1b</code> folder.</li>
<li>Your work must be reproducible from beginning to end. That is, a member of the teaching team should be able to run all code error-free and reproduce the output files.</li>
<li>You use proper English, spelling, and grammar, and write concisely. If there’s any uncertainty in determining a grade here, the <a href="https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_writing.md">UBC MDS writing rubric</a> will be referred to.</li>
<li>If there’s any further uncertainty in determining a grade for this tidy submission portion, the <a href="https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_mech.md">UBC MDS mechanics rubric</a> will be referred to.</li>

<div id="exercise-1-functions-10-points" class="section level2">
<h2>Exercise 1: Functions (10 points)</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you’ll be making a function and fortifying it. The function need not be complicated. The function need not be “serious”, but shouldn’t be nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>Function Ideas</strong></p>
<p>Basic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you repeat any code for a data analysis in STAT 545A? If so, consider making a function for this action.</li>
<li>Write a <em>wrapper</em> around an existing function.
<ul>
<li>For example, perhaps accepting a narrower range of inputs (like not allowing logical vectors), or providing a different output.</li>
<li>A specific example: my <a href="https://github.com/vincenzocoia/rqdist/blob/master/R/rqdist.R#L1"><code>rqdist()</code> function</a> is a wrapper around <code>quantreg::rq()</code>, narrowing its functionality.</li>
<li>It’s usually better to narrow a function’s focus than to broaden, so that a function doesn’t end up doing too much.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Make a function extracting parts of an <code>"lm"</code> object that you can’t easily access (<code>broom</code> aside), or measuring the “difference” between a linear and quadratic fit.</li>
<li>Make a special plot that you’d want to repeat when exploring your data.</li>
<li>You might find a function useful to apply for Exercise 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>Advanced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a new ggplot2 geom. Need inspiration? Fun ideas count – <a href="https://github.com/coolbutuseless/geomlime"><code>geom_lime()</code> and <code>geom_pint()</code></a> are great examples (thanks, Asfar, for finding this) – but it’s not enough to make something like <code>geom_parrot()</code> based on these functions, because there’s not enough original work to answer the questions we have for you.</li>
<li>Fit a Beverton-Holt model (or some other scientifically motivated parametric function) to some data via least squares or some other method.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.tidymodels.org/learn/develop/broom/">Create your own <code>broom</code> tidier function</a> for a model that’s currently incompatible with <code>broom</code> (warning: this uses S3 object oriented programming, but you don’t need to implement that for this assignment).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Caveats</strong></p>
<p>The first three caveats are prone to a penalty of -1 point.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Other sources</strong>: We need to see your own work here. You <em>can</em> use someone’s function as inspiration for your function, just be sure to (1) reference the source of inspiration for your function, and (2) you should be able to answer the questions in this Exercise for your own work.</li>
<li><strong>Too simple</strong>: Your function should involve more than just a calculation that you can do with operations like <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, etc. – even with simple functions like <code>sqrt()</code> that have one argument only. But, add a feature like <code>trim</code> (as in the <code>mean()</code> function, if it makes sense to do so), and you have something that’s no longer simple. So, <code>function(x) x ^ 2</code> is too simple. But, <code>function(x) max(x) - min(x)</code> isn’t too simple, because the <code>max()</code> and <code>min()</code> functions have another option (<code>na.rm</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Nonsense</strong>: The function should be sensible. Example of a nonsense function: <code>function(x, y) x ^ (x + y) + x / y ^ x - 1</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Making more than one function</strong>: You might encounter this situation if a task is too big for one function, and you just wouldn’t be satisfied with yourself if you only made one function. If so, it sounds like you’re well on your way to making an R package in Week 3 (Assignment 2-B), so definitely keep the idea. We’ll only be grading one function for this assignment though, so if you make more than one, please let us know which one you’d like to be graded.</li>

<p>In the space below, document your function:</p>
<ul>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
<strong>Description</strong>: In 1-2 brief sentences, describe what the function does.<ul>
<li>As a model answer, check out the “Description” section (the very first section) in the documentation of an R function that you know and love.</li>
<li>Technical language is OK (like “Generalised Linear Model”), but not a step-by-step written account of each line. If you feel the need to add more details, separate these details from the main description. In fact, many functions have a “Details” section in their documentation! Just check out <code>lm()</code> as an example – but don’t go overboard like that.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
For each <strong>argument</strong>,<ul>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Write the argument name.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Describe the input: What restrictions are there – should it be a vector? A list? A specific type of vector, like numeric? If there’s a default value, specify what the default is.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Briefly justify (1-2 sentences) your choice of name and (if applicable) default value.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
For the <strong>output</strong>:<ul>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Describe the object that’s returned. Is it a vector? A list? Is it a numeric vector? What does the object represent?</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Briefly justify (1-2 sentences) your choice of output format.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s an elaboration on the rubrics:</p>
<p><strong>Generalised</strong></p>
<p>Your function should not be specific to a decision that you made for an analysis. Use function arguments to accomplish being able to use this function in other analyses. The following examples are signs that you need to use more arguments to generalise your function:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your function should not rely on anything from your working environment.</li>
<li>Your function should not rely on “magic numbers” – pre-selected numbers (or options) that appear inside the function that can’t be accessed by a user of the function.
<ul>
<li>For example, maybe <code>quantile(x, type = 1, ...)</code> appears in your function. The choice of 1 is arbitrary.</li>
<li>That is, it’s arbitrary <em>unless</em> it’s specific to your function – <code>type = 1</code> corresponds to the empirical quantile, and this would be fine if your function is <em>designed</em> to calculate the empirical quantile.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Adding additional arguments sometimes means you’ll have to think outside of the box as to how you’ll design your function, but that’s the fun part.</p>
<ul>
<li>At least three of the below are relevant/appropriate, and therefore found in your function (if not, your function may be too simple):
<ul>
<li>Appropriate <code>NA</code> handling, such as with <code>na.rm</code>, if relevant (usually relevant for <em>summarising</em> functions that would appear in <code>dplyr::summarise()</code> – typically not in vectorized functions that would appear in <code>dplyr::mutate()</code>).</li>
<li>Appropriate defaults are used, if relevant. (Your justification is considered here).</li>
<li>The ellipsis (<code>...</code>) is used as an “argument”, if relevant/appropriate.</li>
<li>A “special option” is included, to tweak the function’s behaviour. For example, the <code>trim</code> argument in the <code>mean()</code> function, or <code>type</code> in the <code>quantile()</code> function. Including this doesn’t count if this argument should be absorbed by the ellipsis (can’t double-dip the use of ellipsis and this option)</li>
<li>A second special option is included.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Format</strong></p>
<p>What we’re looking for in terms of the <strong>format</strong> of the input and output:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arguments have appropriate names (you should at least have sound justification).</li>
<li>Input should not take a rigid form. An example that’s too rigid is a data frame that’s expected to have special types of columns.<br />
</li>
<li>The output is consistent – for example, always gives a list. An example of inconsistent output: <code>sapply(1:3, seq_len)</code> gives a list, and <code>sapply(1:3, sqrt)</code> gives an (atomic) vector.</li>
<li>The structure of the input and output makes sense. Sometimes the input and output is a natural choice (as in the <code>sqrt()</code> function), and other times it’s not (as in the <code>lm()</code> function).</li>
<li>You’ve made use of data masking when it makes sense to do so, and used curly-curly (<code>{{ var }}</code>) in your function code.</li>
</ul>

Implement at least one of these two message-bearing methods, using conditionals (<code>if</code> statements) to do so:<ul>

<li>Add a <code>verbose</code> argument (counts as a “special argument” in 1.2), taking a logical input, that keeps the user up-to-date with messages that print to screen as the function is running. This is mostly relevant for functions that could take a long time to run, but for this assignment, it’s OK for any multi-line function.</li>

<h3>1.4 (<strong>Optional</strong>, 1 bonus point)</h3>
<p>Contribute to an open-source R package on GitHub by making an improvement to one of their functions, or perhaps even adding your function to their package. If you’re nervous, maybe ask the developers first via a GitHub Issue or email (check their <code>CONTRIBUTING</code> file for more details, if they have one).</p>
<p>Note: You can’t get above 100% on this assignment.</p>
<p>If you choose to do this, just put a link to the pull request that you made on the R package’s GitHub repository. Your pull request doesn’t need to be accepted by the developers, but your pull request <em>should</em> be realistic in order to get this bonus point.</p>
<p><strong>You can even do this after you submit the assignment</strong>. For example, you might want to wait until we learn about R packages before you do this. If this is the case, just make sure to let your grader know once you submit your pull request, via a GitHub Issue in your homework repository (don’t forget to <code>@tag</code> them!), also including a link to your pull request. But, you have until the deadline of Assignment 5-B to do this, and you only get one attempt!</p>

<p>For this exercise, you’ll be evaluating a model that’s fit separately for each group in some dataset.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe your model is a linear model (using <code>lm()</code>) for each continent in the <code>gapminder::gapminder</code> dataset.</li>
<li>Maybe your model is a distribution of a single variable (using the <a href="https://distplyr.netlify.app/"><code>distplyr</code> package</a>) for each penguin in the <code>palmerpenguins::penguins</code> dataset.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your tasks are as follows.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Make a column of model objects. Do this using the appropriate mapping function from the <code>purrr</code> package. Note: it’s possible you’ll have to make use of nesting, here.<ul>
<li>For <code>distplyr</code>, use a <code>distplyr::dst_*()</code> function of your choosing, like <code>dst_norm()</code> or <code>dst_step()</code>. Note that there aren’t that many <code>dst_*()</code> functions yet, sorry – <code>distplyr</code> is still quite young.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Evaluate the model in a way that interests you. But, you should evaluate something other than a single number for each group. Hint: you’ll need to use another <code>purrr</code> mapping function again.<ul>
<li>For <code>distplyr</code>, use a distributional representation of your choosing, such as quantiles, using the appropriate <code>distplyr::enframe_*()</code> function.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Print out the tibble so far.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Unnest the resulting calculations, and print your final tibble to screen. Make sure your tibble makes sense: column names are appropriate, and you’ve gotten rid of columns that no longer make sense.</li>
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
Don’t just blindly do this exercise: in 1-2 brief sentences, tell us what you’ve just calculated, and in what column.</li>

<h3>2.2 (<strong>Optional</strong>, 1 bonus point)</h3>
<p>Choose one of the following. Following a linear model fit to groups on the gapminder dataset, either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find countries with interesting stories. Sudden, substantial departures from the temporal trend is interesting. How could you operationalize this notion of “interesting”?</li>
<li>Use the residuals to detect countries where your model is a terrible fit. Examples: Are there 1 or more freakishly large residuals, in an absolute sense or relative to some estimate of background variability? Are there strong patterns in the sign of the residuals? E.g., all positive, then all negative, then positive again.</li>
<li>Fit a regression using ordinary least squares and a robust technique. Determine the difference in estimated parameters under the two approaches. If it is large, consider that country “interesting”.</li>
