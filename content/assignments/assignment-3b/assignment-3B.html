<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In Assignment 2-B, you practiced creating an R package. This week, we’ll be creating a Shiny dashboard! You may complete Option A or Option B of this assignment (<em>not both</em>), detailed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Option A:</strong> Add three features to an already-existing BC Liquor shiny app, and deploy it.</li>
<li><strong>Option B:</strong> Create your own shiny app with three features, and deploy it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read all the instructions in this document <em>thoroughly</em> before proceeding with your assignment. The grading rubric is detailed at the very end, and <em>it doubles as a checklist</em> for you to keep track of your progress!</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>This homework was originally developed by Dean Attali, with modifications by Giulio Valentino Dalla Riva, and has been further modified for 2020.</p>

<div id="setup" class="section level2">
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p><em>An important note before you start</em> - it’s easy to get carried away adding lots of design features to a Shiny app, but we’re only expecting simplicity. Design choice is undoubtedly important, but we are mostly focusing on your ability to make these apps. This will be reflected accordingly in the grading rubric, but we encourage you to keep it in mind as you work through the assignment.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will be working within an assignment-3b folder in your homework repo. You will see the “basic” BC Liquor Store app already there. Just delete this if you want to build your own app (Option B).</li>
<li>Think about whether you want to choose Option A or B.</li>
<li>Plan out your app - whether you are modifying the existing BC Liquor dashboard or creating your own app, read through the feature ideas and rubric below, browse through the Shiny app examples, and have a clear plan before you start. This will save you time later!</li>
<li>Get started. Remember to use the rubric as a checklist to ensure that you’ve completed all the steps, and have fun!</li>
</ul>

<div id="feature-ideas" class="section level2">
<h2>Feature ideas</h2>
<p>There are countless possibilities for features, but here are just a few ideas. You can choose any 3 or more ideas from this list or do anything else! Note that many of the examples in this list refer to the BC Liquor app, but they are all still applicable to creating your own Shiny app if that is your chosen option for the assignment.

<div id="if-you-have-a-table-in-your-app" class="section level4">
<h4>If you have a table in your app…</h4>
<ul>
<li>Add an option to sort the table by one of your variables (as an example, in the BC Liquor app, you could sort the results by price!).
<ul>
<li><em>Hint:</em> Use <code>checkboxInput()</code> to get <code>TRUE</code>/<code>FALSE</code> values from the user.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use the DT package to turn a static table into an interactive table.
<ul>
<li><em>Hint:</em> Install the DT package, replace <code>tableOutput()</code> with <code>DT::dataTableOutput()</code> and replace <code>renderTable()</code> with <code>DT::renderDataTable()</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Show the number of results found whenever the filters change. For example, in the BC Liquor app, when searching for Italian wines <code>$20</code> - <code>$40</code>, the app would show the text “We found 122 options for you”.
<ul>
<li><em>Hint:</em> Add a <code>textOutput()</code> to the UI, and in its corresponding <code>renderText()</code> use the number of rows in the <code>filtered()</code> object.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Allow the user to download your table as a .csv file.
<ul>
<li><em>Hint:</em> Look into the <code>downloadButton()</code> and <code>downloadHandler()</code> functions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Allow the user to search for multiple entries simultaneously; for example, in the BC Liquor app, allow the user to search for multiple alcohol types at once instead of wine/beer/etc, one at a time.
<ul>
<li><em>Hint:</em> There are two approaches to do this. Either change the typeInput radio buttons into checkboxes (<code>checkboxGroupInput()</code>) since checkboxes support choosing multiple items, or change typeInput into a select box (<code>selectInput()</code>) with the argument <code>multiple = TRUE</code> to support choosing multiple options.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="if-you-have-a-plot-in-your-app" class="section level4">
<h4>If you have a plot in your app…</h4>
<ul>
<li>Add parameters to the plot.
<ul>
<li><em>Hint:</em> You will need to add input functions that will be used as parameters for the plot. You could use <code>shinyjs::colourInput()</code> to let the user decide on the colours of the bars in the plot.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="other-ideas" class="section level4">
<h4>Other ideas:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Add an image to the UI. In the case of the BC Liquor app, you could add an image of the BC Liquor Store. If you’re building your own app from scratch, an image may make your app more visually interesting or add information!
<ul>
<li><em>Hint:</em> Place the image in a folder named www, and use <code>img(src = &quot;imagename.png&quot;)</code> to add the image.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you know CSS, add CSS to make your app look nicer.
<ul>
<li><em>Hint:</em> Add a CSS file under www and use the function <code>includeCSS()</code> to use it in your app.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Experiment with packages that add extra features to Shiny, such as shinyjs, leaflet, shinydashboard, shinythemes, ggvis.
<ul>
<li><em>Hint:</em> Each package is unique and has a different purpose, so you need to read the documentation of each package in order to know what it provides and how to use it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you have both a plot and a table, place them in separate tabs.
<ul>
<li><em>Hint:</em> Use <code>tabsetPanel()</code> to create an interface with multiple tabs.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Shiny app examples</h2>
<p>Here are some examples of apps built with Shiny - we don’t expect you to achieve the level of complexity in any of these, but they are examples that may inspire you in terms of what you want to do with your own app!</p>

<h2>Rubric</h2>
<div id="tidy-submission-5-points" class="section level3">
<h3>Tidy Submission (5 points)</h3>
<p>Follow these steps to submit your work. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the rubric for a tidy submission below, before doing these steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] (1 pts) Update your main <code>README</code> for your <em>assignment repository</em> (i.e. <code>stat-545b-assignments-GitHub-Username</code>) <strong>with a link to a running instance of your Shiny app.</strong></li>
<li>[ ] (3 pts) Make a <code>README</code> within your <code>assignment-3b</code> folder. The README must include:
<ul>
<li>Your choice of assignment clearly stated: Option A - BC Liquor app, or Option B - your own Shiny app.</li>
<li>A description of your app. In the case of Option A, write about what makes your app different from the “basic” version after implementing your chosen features.</li>
<li>A link to the URL where the app is hosted.</li>
<li>Whatever dataset you will use, acknowledge its source clearly. Remember that we value open, reproducible science: this means that the user of your app should have direct access to the data, or know where to go to access it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>[ ] (1 pts) Tag a release in your assignment repository.</li>
<li>[ ] Submit a link to your tagged release in your assignment repository to canvas.</li>
<li>[ ] (Optional) When you submit to canvas, we would appreciate hearing about your experience with this assignment: what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, things you liked or would have preferred to see, etc. No need to write lots here, this just allows us to make improvements for next year.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="shiny-app-development-15-points" class="section level3">
<h3>Shiny app development (15 points)</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are three features in your Shiny app. Clearly state which three features you are modifying or creating in your code, with comments. Specifically, <em>write a sentence per feature explaining how it is useful</em>. (12 pts, 4 per feature)
<ul>
<li><strong>Option A:</strong> Adding three features to the already existing BC Liquor app.
<ul>
<li>[ ] There’s at least one new functional widget that modifies at least one output. (4 pts)</li>
<li>[ ] There’s at least one change to the UI (aside from the addition of a widget). (4 pts)</li>
<li>[ ] A third feature, whether it’s a change to the UI, or a functional widget. (4 pts)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Option B:</strong> Create your own shiny app with three features, and deploy it.
<ul>
<li>[ ] Feature 1. (4 pts)</li>
<li>[ ] Feature 2. (4 pts)</li>
<li>[ ] Feature 3. (4 pts)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>What are we looking for in your features?</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Variety.</em> Including three tables as part of your dashboard and having the same exact feature for each of them (e.g. a filtering option, even if the tables are distinct) will be penalized; at least 2 of the 3 features must be unique.</li>
<li>For either option A or B, we will evaluate the <em>usefulness</em> of your features in the context of your app (does it add to the user experience?). We expect your features to be sensible, meaning that they add to the user experience in a way that makes sense - as an example, adding a filtering option for “country” in a table that only has data for Canada does not seem very useful, even if you added the filtering feature correctly. If we consider any of your features to be irrelevant for the app, 0.5pts will be penalized for that particular feature.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>RRR (3 pts):
<ul>
<li>[ ] Code runs without errors and it is appropriately annotated, legible, and easy to follow. (1.5 pts)</li>
<li>[ ] Your app should be deployed online on shinyapps.io (or on another server if you’d like). Make sure your app actually works online (sometimes your app will work in RStudio but will have errors on shinyapps.io - make sure you deploy early and often to make debugging easier). (1.5 pts)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Submit the link to your tagged release in Canvas when you have finished all of the above and your assignment.</strong></p>
