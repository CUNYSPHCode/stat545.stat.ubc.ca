<h4>Prepare for Class</h4>
<p>Have you completed the exercises in “Class 00A”? Do that first before starting!</p>
<ul>
<li>Watch the STAT 545 Video Series: Class 01A</li>
<li>Read…</li>
</ul>

<div id="during-class" class="section level4">
<h4>During Class</h4>
<ul>
<li>Intro to STAT545A &amp; what to expect from the class - enter syllabus (~20 min)</li>
<li>5 minute break + additional time in case there are troubleshooting issues with R &amp; RStudio that need to be solved individually.</li>
<li>Why R? + Lecture worksheet / In-class demo (~50 minutes)
<ul>
<li>Rather than using breakout rooms in the first class (since it may be the first time using R and RStudio for many), I think alternating between an in-class demo where everything in <a href="https://stat545guidebook.netlify.app/introduction-to-r.html">2.5 Orientation to R</a> &amp; “don’t save your workspace” is demonstrated while alternating with students completing the worksheet may be good.</li>
<li>Example of the workflow (1) Vincenzo demonstrates Functions I and Functions II, could simply be an improvised demo in R (2) Students complete the relevant section of the worksheet, and click “yes” on Zoom when they are done (3) When all or almost all students have clicked “yes” (if there is a couple that have not, TAs reach out directly to ask), go on to the next task.</li>
