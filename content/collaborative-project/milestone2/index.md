# STAT 545A Collaborative Project: Milestone 2

**Deadline**: Saturday, October 2, 2021 at 22:00 PT

**Points**: 100

By completing this project, students are expected to be able to:

1. Collaborate on a project with a partner using the git + GitHub workflow.
2. Troubleshoot broken R code.
3. Rewrite code to address instructions.

This is the second of two milestones for completing this project.

## Exercise 0: Merge one Pull Request per teammate

__30 points__

_Read this exercise, but do it last. This exercise is identical to the one in Milestone 1._

Every teammate should submit at least one pull request for this milestone, and have a __different__ teammate merge the pull request after reviewing the contents of the pull request. You'll need to decide who will work on what, and by when (remember, aim to finish with sufficient time for your group members to conduct a review of your work). Keep in mind that most of the work in this milestone is in the troubleshooting document. 

__Note__: Work together as a team to get this done. If one of your teammates is having trouble with this procedure, help them out! Sometimes a merge conflict will happen, and it's best to work as a team to figure out how to resolve these issues.

__Grading__: 

- 4 points awarded for the creation of a complete set of pull requests (i.e., one pull request per teammate).
- 14 points awarded for the successful merging of a complete set of pull requests. 
- 4 points awarded for the comment(s) kicking off the pull request.
- 4 points awarded for the follow-up comment(s) from a reviewer. 
- 4 points awarded if each teammate gets the chance to act as a reviewer/merger of someone else's pull request.
- _Penalty_ of up to 4 points if the total amount of work contained in pull requests does not amount to much. We just want to make sure that, when you're working on this project, you're largely working on branches. It's OK to commit directly to the main branch without a pull request, but this should be the exception, not the norm.


## Exercise 1: Troubleshooting document

__58 points__

1. Put the [`troubleshooting-2.Rmd` document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBC-STAT/stat545.stat.ubc.ca/master/content/collaborative-project/milestone2/troubleshooting-2.Rmd) in your repository. (You can either download this file, or just copy and paste its contents into a new file that you call `troubleshooting-2.Rmd`.)
2. Fix all the errors in the `troubleshooting-2.Rmd` document, as outlined in the document. (__55 points, errors are equally weighed__)
3. Knit the document to an md file (just click "knit" in RStudio). (__3 points; only 1 point if the document is not up-to-date with its Rmd source.__)

## Exercise 2: README file and tidy submission

__10 points__

- Update your README file to reflect any changes that have happened in your repository. This will probably only be a very small change, and that's OK. (__5 points__)
- Your repository is clean and organized. For example, there aren't any "old" files, and there are no relics (such as, if you once output to html, but no longer, then if present, that html file is an unnecessary relic). (__5 points__)

## Exercise 3: Submitting this Milestone

__2 points__

To submit this Milestone, you'll be tagging a release on your GitHub repository, and adding a link to the release on canvas. 

_How to tag a release_:

1. Navigate to the main page (root) of your collaborative GitHub repository.
2. There should be a small link on the right-hand-side of your page that says "Create a new release". Click that.
  - You might also be able to get to the same place by clicking on the "tags" link beside where your branches are listed. 
3. For the tag version, put `m2.0` (for "milestone 2.0").
4. Choose a release title and description (this is less important).
5. Do __not__ check off "This is a pre-release".
6. Click "Publish Release".
7. Put a link to that release as a submission on the Collaborative Project Milestone 1
    - You won't lose marks for _not_ submitting your link to canvas, but it would really help us out if you do this! Thank you!

_If you want to "re-tag" your release_:

If you want to change your submission _after_ tagging a release, you can still do this if it's before the deadline. Just increase the secondary version number by one -- so, make the tag version `m1.1`, then `m1.2`, etc.

__Grading__: 2 points awarded for tagging a release.
