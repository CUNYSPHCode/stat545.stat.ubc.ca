  + If there is anything that needs to be fixed in your README, it would be detailed in the Milestone 1 feedback provided by a TA in an Issue in your repo.

+ [ ] Organization
  + [ ] No files should be duplicated (for example, if you have a TB2.Rmd in your "Milestone 2" subfolder, and another TB2.Rmd in the root of your repo, the latter should be deleted).
  + [ ] Files should be organized in subfolders, by Milestone. Therefore, your repo should contain:
    + [ ] A README.md file in the root of your repo
    + [ ] A teamwork document in the root of your repo
    + [ ] Milestone 1 subfolder
    + [ ] Milestone 2 subfolder
    + [ ] Milestone 3 subfolder
