<!-- ******TUESDAY'S CLASS****** -->

## Tuesday's Class `r tues_class_num`: Collaboration with git and GitHub

```{r tues-date}
cat(tues_date_pretty)
```

From today's class, students are anticipated to be able to:

- FILL_THIS_IN

#### Prepare for Class

- Lab:
  - Take charge of their collaborative repos
  - Create a teamwork document
  - Branching; PR
  - Opening Issues


- Watch [STAT 545 Episode 2-A: Git and GitHub for an Organized Project](https://youtu.be/l2ftm-YwJs8) (a copy is also available on Canvas)

- Tutorial
  + Adapting the material in [Topic 2: GitHub](https://stat545guidebook.netlify.app/introduction-to-stat-545-and-github.html#topic-2-github-35-min) into a document that students can follow through, but only until (and including) "1.5.3 GitHub as cloud storage - Activity".
  + Simply having them follow the [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) tutorial, although I'm not sure if it gets a bit complicated with branching.
+ Demonstration:
  + Demo [the typical workflow](https://stat545guidebook.netlify.app/the-version-control-workflow.html#the-typical-workflow-8-min) (~8 min)
  + Students follow [the typical workflow activity](https://stat545guidebook.netlify.app/the-version-control-workflow.html#the-typical-workflow-activity-5-min) in the repo that they created as pre-work (~5 min)
