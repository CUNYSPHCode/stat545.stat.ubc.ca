    "**INSTRUCTIONS:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Read through the following instructions carefully to explore the different features of R Markdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to the top of this document and explore the YAML header. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Open a new Rmd document (but don't close this one!) in RStudio via \"File\" > \"New File\" > \"R Markdown\". Accept the default output format of HTML. See the differences with this document in the header? As you can see, when I started writing this Rmd, I scrapped everything that appears below the YAML header - this is common practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Add a code chunk below these instructions (below **START**) via \"Insert\" -> \"R\" (look for this at the top of this Rmd document window). Or by: cmd + option + I (MAC) / ctrl + alt + i (WINDOWS).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The R packages that you installed previously are ready in your local machine, but to be able to use them in this document, you must **load** them first. To do this, add the following code into the code chunk that you just created.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Create a new code chunk. Print out the \"mtcars\" dataframe to explore the output, and then convert it to a tibble using the tibble::as_tibble() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. In another code chunk, print out the \"gapminder\" dataframe to explore the output, and try out the DT::datatable() function to see what it looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Add some markdown commentary to this comparative analysis! If you were to give this document to someone to read through your \"analysis\", a few notes would make it more readable. Use at least 3 text markup [features of R Markdown](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf?_ga=2.83099670.1689512796.1597728464-1784159993.1567907747) - see the second page of the cheatsheet on the left under \"Pandoc's Markdown\".\n",

[Here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) are a bunch of YAML options that you can explore at your own pace.\n",
    "\n",
    "**INSTRUCTIONS:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Delete everything between the YAML header and \"2.2 What we learn to do, we learn by doing\" in this document, such that the YAML header is immediately followed by the 2.2 section header.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Change the Author to your name. You deserve some credit!\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Keep the \"md\" intermediate file with `keep_md: true`\n",
    "- Add a theme. My favorite is cerulean: `theme: cerulean`\n",
    "- Add a table of contents with `toc: true`\n",
    "- Make the toc float: `toc_float: true`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Save this document to a reasonable filename and location. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Knit the results! You can do this by clicking on \"Knit > Knit to HTML\" or do File > Knit Document. RStudio should display a preview of the resulting HTML. Also, look at the file browser, you should see the R Markdown document (my-first-markdown.Rmd) and the resulting HTML (my-first-markdown.html)\n",

    "Another bus stop! Couldn't get previous exercises to work?

Need more help? Ask any of the TAs, we'll help you troubleshoot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like YAML is metadata for the Rmd document, *code chunk options* are metadata for the code chunk. Specify them within the `{r}` at the top of a code chunk, separated by commas.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. In any of the code chunks that you have created above, hide the code from the output with `echo = FALSE`. It would look like this `{r echo = FALSE}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Prevent warnings from the chunk that loads packages with `warning = FALSE`.\n",
