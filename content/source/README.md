This folder contains the STAT 545 worksheets **with solutions**, which are autograded by nbgrader. The name of this folder (`source`) is required by nbgrader.


Notes:

- **EDIT THIS VERSION** of the assignments -- this is the source. 
- One folder per worksheet is required by nbgrader. It should be called `worksheet_0xy`, where `x` is the worksheet number, and `y` is either "a" or "b" depending on whether we're on STAT 545A or B.
