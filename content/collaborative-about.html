<p>Everything you need to know about the collaborative project can be found here.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is not for STAT 545B!</p>
<p>By completing this project, students are expected to be able to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Collaborate on a project with a partner using GitHub.</li>
<li>Troubleshoot broken code.</li>
<li>Rewrite code to address instructions.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<p>There are three milestones:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Milestone 1 due <del><strong>Friday, September 18th.</strong></del> <strong>Saturday, September 19th at 23:59 PST</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Milestone 2 due <strong>Friday, September 25th at 23:59 PST.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Milestone 3 and evaluation document due <strong>Friday, October 16th at 23:59 PST.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="general-workflow" class="section level2">
<h2>General Workflow</h2>
<p>Each milestone will include a troubleshooting exercise in the form of an <code>.Rmd</code> file. Your team needs to fix the errors.</p>
<p>You must work on <em>branches</em> in your GitHub repository, and submit a pull request when you’re ready for your teammate(s) to review your work. The team comments on the incoming changes (in the pull request), and makes changes to the branch based on the comments (if needed). Once the team agrees the branch should be merged, the merge is completed and the pull request is closed.</p>
</div>
<div id="grading-scheme" class="section level2">
<h2>Grading scheme</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The team troubleshooting project accounts for 35% of the total course grade, and is graded by assigning 100 points overall.</p></li>
<li><p>Each Milestone is graded as a group grade.</p></li>
<li><p>Milestones 2 and 3 are graded as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Troubleshooting is worth 15 points</li>
<li>Pull requests are worth 15 points, based on:
<ul>
<li>A good title and description. A good title is self-explanatory, and a good description clearly states <em>what</em> was changed in the pull request and <em>why</em>.</li>
<li>Productive discussion. Both students engaged in discussion in the pull request, and made changes to the document accordingly.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>At the end of the project, each member will submit a quick evaluation of the other team members, and themselves. This evaluation is worth 10 points.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Submitting a Milestone</h2>
<p><em>(These instructions will also appear on every milestone)</em></p>
<p>To submit a Milestone, you’ll be tagging a release on your GitHub repository, and submitting a link to that release on canvas.</p>
<p><em>How to tag a release</em>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Navigate to the main page (root) of your collaborative GitHub repository.</li>
<li>There should be a small link on the right-hand-side of your page that says “Create a new release”. Click that.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>You might also be able to get to the same place by clicking on the “tags” link beside where your branches are listed.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>For the tag version, put <code>mV.0</code>, where <code>V</code> is the Milestone number.</li>
<li>Choose a release title and description (this is less important).</li>
<li>Do <strong>not</strong> check off “This is a pre-release”.</li>
<li>Click “Publish Release”.</li>
<li>Put a link to that release as a submission on the Collaborative Project Milestone in canvas.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>You won’t lose marks for <em>not</em> doing this, but it would really help us out if you do this! Thank you!</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Tagging another release</em>:</p>
<p>If you want to change your submission <em>after</em> tagging a release, you can still do this if it’s before the deadline. Just increase the secondary version number by one – so, make the tag version <code>mV.1</code>, then <code>mV.2</code>, etc., where <code>V</code> is the Milestone number.</p>
