<h2>How to contact a member of the teaching team</h2>
<p>You can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send a private message over <a href="https://stat545ubc.slack.com">Slack</a> <strong>(recommended)</strong></li>
<li>Send an email (check out the <a href="#teaching_team">teaching team</a> section)</li>

<h2>Who to contact</h2>
<div id="have-an-issue-with-the-way-you-were-evaluated-on-a-project" class="section level3">
<h3>Have an issue with the way you were evaluated on a project?</h3>
<p>Your TA will have left an Issue on your project GitHub repository. It’s best to continue the conversation there to retain context.</p>
<p>If you really prefer not, contact the TA directly that graded your work.</p>
</div>
<div id="have-an-issue-with-the-way-you-were-evaluated-even-after-discussion-with-the-ta" class="section level3">
<h3>Have an issue with the way you were evaluated, even after discussion with the TA?</h3>
<p>If you’ve been having a discussion using a GitHub Issue, loop Vincenzo in by tagging him: <code>@vincenzocoia</code>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, contact Vincenzo directly.</p>
