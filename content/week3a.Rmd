<!-- ******TUESDAY'S CLASS****** -->

## Tuesday's Class `r tues_class_num`: FILL_THIS_IN_WITH_TOPIC

```{r tues-date}
cat(tues_date_pretty)
```

From today's class, students are anticipated to be able to:

- FILL_THIS_IN

+ Topics to be covered (~20 minutes of in-class demo); I think this is easier learnt through practice so probably not much more time needed)
  + tidyverse
  + dplyr
  + piping
  + tibbles (*as part of the new course outline, it was discussed on #25*)


#### Prepare for Class

- Watch the STAT 545 Video Series: Class `r tues_class_num`



#### During Class

+ Lecture worksheet (~40 minutes)

+ Break (~5 minutes)

+ Introduce (and maybe start?) Mini-Data Analysis Project (~25 minutes)

<!-- ******THURSDAY'S CLASS****** -->

## Thursday's Class `r thurs_class_num`: FILL_THIS_IN_WITH_TOPIC

```{r thurs-date}
cat(thurs_date_pretty)
```

From today's class, students are anticipated to be able to:

- FILL_THIS_IN

*These refer to adapted sections of the 2019 STAT545 guidebook*:
+ Why data visualization? Just plot it + The grammar of graphics (~20 minutes)
+ In-class demo of creating a scatterplot (~10 minutes)
+ Break (~5 minutes)
+ Lecture worksheet (~45 minutes) - in breakout rooms
+ Share your work! (~10 minutes) *Suggestion: Students would go back to the main room and maybe share their graphs with the class? Voluntarily; they could send screenshots / images through the chat and instructor could showcase a few*


#### Prepare for Class

- Watch the STAT 545 Video Series: Class `r thurs_class_num`

#### During Class
