<h1>How to use Slack, and for what</h1>
<p>Slack is the main forum for STAT 545 for discussion between students, TAs, and the instructor. Students will be given the Slack invite link at the beginning of the semester.</p>
<p>We prefer Slack for all communications but in some cases you can email us instead. Find emails on the <a href="https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/#team">teaching team</a> section.</p>
<p>The teaching team can’t guarantee that they will be able to respond to student messages outside of typical workday hours (0900-1700 PST). So, please be mindful of a 17:00 PST cutoff on Fridays when asking assignment-related questions.</p>
<div id="use-the-general-channel-for-most-communications" class="section level3">
<h3>Use the <em>#general</em> channel for most communications</h3>
<p>TAs, Vincenzo and other students can participate and benefit from these conversations. Examples of appropriate topics for <em>#general</em> are described below:</p>
<div id="clarifying-concepts-from-lectures" class="section level4">
<h4>Clarifying concepts from lectures</h4>
<p>Examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What’s the difference between a <code>tibble</code> and a <code>data.frame</code>?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Does <code>set.seed()</code> work on all computers (OS) and versions of R?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there a difference between <code>[]</code> and <code>[[]]</code>?</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="asking-about-course-organization" class="section level4">
<h4>Asking about course organization</h4>
<p>e.g. the syllabus, course policies, assignment deadlines…</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When is the deadline for Assignment 1?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For next lecture on Tuesday, are we going to be reviewing the upcoming project?</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="clarifying-instructions-in-assignments-and-other-deliverables" class="section level4">
<h4>Clarifying instructions in assignments and other deliverables</h4>
<p>Ping the TA or instructor if you know which person developed the instructions (<code>@Name-of-TA-or-instructor</code>).</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For assignment 1a, question 3, can I pick any character variable in my dataset or does it need to be one with 3 or more categories? <span class="citation">@Victor</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For assignment 2, do I use the same dataset that I used in assignment 1?</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="when-you-are-stuck-and-need-help" class="section level4">
<h4>When you are stuck and need help</h4>
<p>On assignments, workshops, group projects.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For worksheet 4, question 2.1, I can’t seem to get the correct answer. Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>answer2.1 &lt;- mtcars %&gt;% 
     nest(cyl) %&gt;%
     ...</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For assignment 3, I keep getting an error when installing the package <code>distplyr</code>. This is the code and error message: <code>...code and errors...</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Post an appropriate amount of details to get the help you want. Ideally use <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/help/"><code>reprex</code></a>, but at minimum provide your code, and any error messages.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="when-to-message-a-ta-or-vincenzo-privately" class="section level3">
<h3>When to message a TA or Vincenzo privately</h3>
<p>If you are still stuck <strong>after</strong> trying <em>#general</em>, then you can message a TA for more help. Instead messaging just one TA, please consider making a group chat and message all of the TAs, so that the most available TA can help.</p>
<p>Example situations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Hi TAs, I posted in <em>#general</em> for help, but I’m still stuck on question 2.1 of worksheet 4. Can I get some help to work through this?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a TA feels that your message is inappropriate for a private conversation (e.g. it might be helpful for other students to see), they may redirect you to posting in the <em>#general</em> channel.</p>
<div id="when-you-have-questions-or-concerns-about-your-grades" class="section level4">
<h4>When you have questions or concerns about your grades</h4>
<p>Either post an issue on your homework repo (preferred), or contact the marking TA on slack.</p>
<p><em>Only message Vincenzo if you are still unsatistified with your grade, after talking with your TA</em></p>
</div>
<div id="when-you-have-need-a-deadline-extension" class="section level4">
<h4>When you have need a deadline extension</h4>
<p>Contact your TA if it’s only for one upcoming deadline. If you need multiple deadline extensions for an extenuating circumstance, consider contacting Vincenzo</p>
</div>
<div id="when-there-is-conflict-with-another-student-in-a-group-project" class="section level4">
<h4>When there is conflict with another student in a group project</h4>
<p>For example, when you feel that your partner is not pulling their weight.</p>

<h1>Other guidelines for using Slack</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Use <a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/help/articles/115000769927-Use-threads-to-organize-discussions-"><strong>threads</strong></a> to keep conversations organized</p></li>
<li><p>If posting code, use ``` (backticks). It’s way easier to read. Even better, use <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/help/"><code>reprex</code></a></p></li>
