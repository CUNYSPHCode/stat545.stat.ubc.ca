# STAT 545 Worksheet Development team

Each worksheet will be overseen by one member of the STAT 545 teaching team (the "worksheet leader")

1. The worksheet leader provides instructions on where to gather worksheet questions. 
    - The ASDA team may not have the resources to make new questions. So if new questions are pertinent, then it's up to the worksheet leader to make these. 
2. The ASDA team assembles a worksheet from the instructions in an `.Rmd` file, and writes tests using the R `testthat` package for each question. The worksheet is to be made on a branch of the `stat545.stat.ubc.ca` GitHub repository.
    - Let's start by giving the ASDA team at least 2 days to work on a worksheet -- we'll get a better sense as we continue.
    - Instructions for making an autograded worksheet can be found in the `worksheets-and-autograding.md` file in this folder.
3. The ASDA team initiates a pull request on GitHub whenever they've produced a draft of the worksheet.
4. Initial review process (which should be given at least 4 days): The worksheet leader will review the worksheet, and further changes may be needed -- who makes the change will depend on the type of change, but this should be made clear by the worksheet leader in the pull request.
    - If needed, the worksheet leader will add more questions to the worksheet.
5. Second review process (which should be given at least 3 days): Once the `.Rmd` file is polished to the worksheet leader's liking, they will let another member of the STAT 545 teaching team (the "second reader") know that it's ready for their review. It's up to the second reader to state when they no longer request changes to the document. 
    - To determine what changes should be made, the two members of the STAT 545 teaching team should come to a consensus.
6. Once the second reader OK's the worksheet, the ASDA team produces a student-facing version of the worksheet (instructions in the `worksheets-and-autograding.md` file).
7. The worksheet leader is responsible for "launching" the worksheet (adding it to the website).
    - The worksheet leader might ask the ASDA team to make changes if things aren't quite right. 

And as always, if anyone is unsure of anything, you can always ask :)
