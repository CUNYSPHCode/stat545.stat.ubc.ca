# STAT 545 Worksheet Development team

1. The STAT 545 teaching team provides instructions on where to gather worksheet questions. 
    - The ASDA team may not have the resources to make new questions. So if new questions are pertinent, then it's up to the teaching team to make these. 
2. The ASDA team assembles a worksheet from the instructions in an `.Rmd` file, and writes tests using the R `testthat` package for each question. The worksheet is to be made on a branch of the `stat545.stat.ubc.ca` GitHub repository.
    - Instructions for making an autograded worksheet can be found in the `worksheets-and-autograding.md` file in this folder.
3. The ASDA team initiates a pull request on GitHub whenever they've produced a draft of the worksheet.
4. The STAT 545 teaching team will review the worksheet, and further changes may be needed -- who makes the change will depend on the type of change, but this should be made clear by the STAT 545 teaching team in the pull request.
    - If needed, the STAT 545 teaching team will add more questions to the worksheet. 
5. Once the `.Rmd` file is polished, the ASDA team produces a student-facing version of the worksheet.
