This folder contains textbook-like material developed for STAT 545. Specifically:

1. the stuff that was previously under the "Topics" tab on the original stat545.com website that is now being hosted in the new "STAT 545" book at stat545.com
2. some other content developed by previous instructors / guest lectures.

Future processing here will probably consist of removing stuff related to (1) since it's being hosted elsewhere, and incorporating the stuff related to (2) into the STAT 545A/547M courses.
