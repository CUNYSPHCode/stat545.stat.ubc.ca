Topics that are currently not discussed, that may belong in STAT 545:

- Continuous Integration (with GitHub Actions)
- docker (or just in general, environment management)
- Cloud computing
- bookdown, for writing a thesis?
- blogdown, for making a website? This might be a stretch -- not really related to data analysis.
- using blogdown, 
- making a bookdown book, 
- adding citations to markdown, 
- numbering and referencing sections in an Rmd, 
- GitHub Pages (briefly discussed in 13A)
- Rmd presentations (briefly discussed in 13A -- could probably be put in with the authoring topic, since this only took me 5 minutes to demonstrate)
