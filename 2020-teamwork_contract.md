# Teamwork Contract

- Vincenzo and Icíar meet once per week to discuss course development.
- To make changes, open a new branch on this repo; come up with draft work; start a pull request to initiate discussion.
    - Once the pull request is made, or any feedback is made, the other person gives feedback within 3 working days directly on that pull request.
- Icíar will work max 10 hours per week.
- Weekly meeting agendas go as an Issue in this repo, and can be added to by anyone on this team.
- Asana will be used for task management.
